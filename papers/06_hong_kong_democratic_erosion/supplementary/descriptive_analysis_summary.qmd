This document summarizes the exploratory descriptive analysis that identified
Hong Kong's post-2019 democratic erosion as a viable paper topic. The full
analysis code is in `analysis/01_descriptive_analysis.qmd` and
`analysis/03_figures.qmd`.

## Key Findings

1. **HK is the most extreme cross-national outlier in ABS Wave 5** on nearly
   every democratic attitude indicator (z = +3.18 on perceived democratic
   deficit, z = −2.09 on freedom to organize).

2. **Within-wave quasi-experiment**: W5 fieldwork (Oct 2019 – May 2021) spans
   the NSL. Pre/post comparison shows 18 of 24 variables significantly changed,
   with the largest effect on democracy suitability (d = −0.54).

3. **Institutional trust paradoxically *increased* post-NSL** (trust in police
   +0.49, government +0.48), likely reflecting compositional/censorship effects.

4. **The "critical citizens" correlation flips in HK**: democratic commitment
   correlates *positively* with democratic satisfaction (r = +0.13), the opposite
   of every other ABS country.

5. **Steep generational gradient**: 18–29 year-olds report trust in police at
   1.92 vs 2.87 for 60+ (on a 4-point scale).

6. **HK-Taiwan divergence** on democracy suitability, trust in police, electoral
   fairness, and freedom to organize — opposite directions from the same W4
   baseline.

## Literature Gap

Blenkitni (2023) analyzed the Umbrella Movement's impact using ABS W3–W4 and
explicitly called for W5 analysis. No published cross-national study has used
ABS W5 to examine HK's post-2019 democratic erosion in comparative context.
