==========================================
Generated: 2026-02-20 07:04:56

Models: M1=govt_withholds_info (ABS, ordered logit, ref=W2)
        M2=corrupt_witnessed    (ABS, ordered logit, ref=W1)
        M3=trust_media         (KAMOS, OLS, ref=2016)
        M4=trust_ngo           (KAMOS, OLS, ref=2016)
        M5=trust_national_assembly (KAMOS, OLS, ref=2016)

Ideology variable — ABS: 'NOT FOUND' | KAMOS: 'ideology'

RESULTS:
--------
  M1 (Govt withholds info): ideology variable not available — interaction skipped
  M2 (Corrupt witnessed): ideology variable not available — interaction skipped
  M3 (Trust: media): 1 interaction term(s), p range [0.644, 0.644]
  M4 (Trust: civil society): 1 interaction term(s), p range [0.648, 0.648]
  M5 (Trust: national assembly): 1 interaction term(s), p range [0.491, 0.491]

CONCLUSION: No wave×ideology interaction significant at p < .05 in any model.
