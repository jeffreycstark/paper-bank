## STUB 1: "Demobilization by Subtraction" — theoretical contribution paragraph
## Location: Introduction, after the Levitsky/Schedler/Gerschewski paragraph

The concept advanced here—demobilization by subtraction—is distinct from the two 
mechanisms most commonly invoked to explain political quiescence under 
authoritarianism. The first, repression-driven demobilization, holds that citizens 
withdraw from political life because the costs of participation have been raised 
through coercion, surveillance, or the threat of punishment.[^fn_repression] The 
second, co-optation, holds that citizens acquiesce because they have been 
incorporated into the regime's distributional networks and calculate that loyalty 
pays better than resistance.[^fn_cooptation] Both mechanisms presuppose an active 
regime strategy directed at the population. Demobilization by subtraction operates 
differently. Its proximate cause is not an action taken against citizens but an 
action taken against the political field itself: the removal of the credible 
alternative around which civic mobilization had organized. The result is not 
fear-based withdrawal or interest-based compliance but something closer to what 
Gaventa termed "quiescence"—the internalization of powerlessness that follows 
from the sustained absence of viable channels for political expression.[^fn_gaventa] 
Where Lukes' third dimension of power operates by shaping preferences so that 
grievances never form, demobilization by subtraction operates one step later: 
grievances may persist, but the perceived vehicle for their expression has been 
eliminated, producing a cascade of behavioral and attitudinal adjustment that is 
visible across multiple survey dimensions simultaneously.[^fn_lukes]

## STUB 2: Roadmap paragraph
## Location: Introduction, final paragraph before Section 2

The remainder of this article is organized as four acts corresponding to the 
four available survey waves. Each section opens with a brief account of the 
political conditions prevailing at the time of the survey, then turns to the 
Asian Barometer data to trace how those conditions registered in citizen 
attitudes and behaviors. The analysis tracks five thematic domains across 
waves: political participation, authoritarian governance preferences, 
democratic expectations, corruption experience and perception, and media 
engagement and political interest. A concluding section draws out the 
theoretical implications of the Cambodian sequence for the study of 
authoritarian durability and democratic aspiration.

## STUB 3: 2008 political context
## Location: "The Quiet Kingdom" section, after the first two paragraphs

The CPP's dominance by 2008 rested on institutional foundations that went far 
beyond electoral mechanics. The party had constructed a dense patronage network 
linking the central state to village-level administration, with commune chiefs 
serving as the capillary system through which resources, information, and 
political loyalty flowed.[^fn_cpp_structure] The military and security services 
were thoroughly integrated into the party apparatus, and the judiciary operated 
as an instrument of executive power rather than an independent check upon 
it.[^fn_judiciary] Economic growth, driven by the garment export sector, 
construction, and an expanding tourism industry, provided a material foundation 
for the regime's implicit social contract: stability and modest prosperity in 
exchange for political acquiescence.[^fn_economy]

The opposition landscape was fragmented and demoralized. The Sam Rainsy Party 
(SRP), the most prominent non-CPP formation, commanded a loyal but limited 
urban constituency and suffered from periodic leadership crises as Sam Rainsy 
himself cycled between exile and return. The Human Rights Party, led by Kem 
Sokha, drew support from a distinct base but lacked the organizational reach 
to challenge the CPP's rural dominance. Neither party, operating independently, 
presented a credible threat to CPP hegemony—a structural condition that would 
change dramatically with their merger four years later.[^fn_opposition]

## STUB 4: CNRP formation and 2013 mobilization context
## Location: "The Awakening" section, after the "politically activated" paragraph

The CNRP's formation in July 2012 was itself a product of political learning. 
Previous opposition efforts had foundered on precisely the fragmentation that 
the CPP exploited: multiple parties splitting the non-CPP vote, personal 
rivalries preventing coordination, and the absence of a unified organizational 
infrastructure capable of matching the CPP's commune-level reach. The merger 
of the SRP and the Human Rights Party, brokered through extended negotiations 
between Sam Rainsy and Kem Sokha, resolved the coordination problem at a 
stroke.[^fn_cnrp_formation] The resulting party offered voters something 
genuinely new in Cambodian politics: a single, unified alternative to the 
CPP with recognizable leaders, a coherent platform, and—critically—the 
organizational capacity to mobilize supporters in both urban and peri-urban 
constituencies.

The mobilization dynamics visible in the 2012 survey data intensified 
dramatically in the months that followed. The July 2013 national election 
became the most competitive in Cambodia's post-UNTAC history, driven by a 
potent combination of youth demographics, social media penetration, and 
economic grievance. Facebook, which had reached an estimated 1.5 million 
Cambodian users by 2013, served as both an organizational tool and an 
alternative information ecosystem that partially circumvented CPP control 
of broadcast media.[^fn_social_media] The CNRP's campaign messaging—centered 
on anti-corruption, land rights, wages for garment workers, and a promise 
to bring genuine democratic accountability—resonated with a generation of 
voters who had no memory of the Khmer Rouge and little patience for the 
stability-first bargain their parents had accepted.[^fn_youth]

The election results shocked the political establishment. The CNRP won 55 
of 123 National Assembly seats, reducing the CPP's margin to its narrowest 
since 1993. Allegations of systematic electoral fraud triggered months of 
mass protest in Phnom Penh, with demonstrations regularly drawing crowds 
estimated in the tens of thousands. For observers and participants alike, 
the political settlement that had governed Cambodia since the late 1990s 
appeared to be unraveling.[^fn_2013_election]

## STUB 5: Democratic assessment triad paragraph
## Location: "The Awakening" section, after the "9.58" paragraph

The specific configuration of the democratic assessment triad in 2012 
is theoretically revealing. The past-present-future structure—low past 
(3.97), middling present (5.85), stratospheric future (9.58)—is not 
the signature of a population evaluating its democratic institutions on 
the basis of lived experience. A population grounded in experiential 
assessment would be expected to rate the future as a modest extrapolation 
from the present, not as a near-perfect score that exceeds the present 
by nearly four points. What the 2012 configuration captures instead is 
a hope-driven democratic orientation: the conviction that the current 
political order is transitional and that the democratic destination is 
both certain and imminent. This orientation, as subsequent waves would 
reveal, proved extraordinarily sensitive to political events—precisely 
because it was grounded in expectation rather than experience.

## STUB 6: Media paragraph for W3
## Location: "The Awakening" section, after the traditional values paragraph

The media and political engagement measures complete the portrait of 
a mobilized citizenry. Political interest stood at 2.57 on a four-point 
scale, and following political news registered at 3.07—both the highest 
values in the Cambodian ABS series. Political discussion, at 1.45, 
remained modest, suggesting that the activation captured in 2012 was 
more a matter of individual attention and institutional engagement than 
of deliberative civic culture. The internet news measure presents a 
methodological puzzle: at 5.78, it sits far above any subsequent wave 
(W4 and W6 both register 2.17), a gap too large to reflect real-world 
change alone. The most likely explanation is a shift in question wording 
or response scale between Waves 3 and 4, and this variable should be 
interpreted with caution in cross-wave comparisons.[^fn_internet]

[^fn_internet]: The ABS questionnaire underwent revisions between Waves 3 
and 4 that affected several media consumption items. The original 
questionnaires should be consulted to verify whether the internet news 
variable reflects a genuine scale change. [NOTE: Jeff, you flagged this 
in the prospecting memo — worth a footnote to the ABS codebook here.]

## STUB 7: Post-2013 election crisis
## Location: "The Reckoning" section — NOTE: you have two versions of the 
## opening here. I'm writing this to follow your newer, stronger opening 
## ("That demonstration began at the ballot box..."). Delete the old version.

[This stub replaces the old "\[STUB: 2-3 paragraphs on the post-2013 
election crisis\]" — but you've already partially written this into the 
newer opening. What remains needed is the bridge from the January 2014 
crackdown to the 2015 survey moment. Here is that bridge:]

The "Culture of Dialogue" that emerged from the July 2014 agreement 
between Sam Rainsy and Hun Sen was, in retrospect, less a genuine political 
opening than a controlled decompression. The CNRP entered parliament and 
gained access to committee chairmanships, lending the arrangement a veneer 
of power-sharing. But the underlying dynamics had not changed: the CPP 
retained control of the security forces, the judiciary, and the National 
Election Committee, while the CNRP's capacity for mass mobilization—its 
primary source of leverage—was progressively constrained through targeted 
legal harassment of its leaders and selective restrictions on public 
assembly.[^fn_culture_dialogue] By 2015, the dialogue had largely stalled, 
and the political atmosphere had shifted from the hopeful if chaotic energy 
of 2013 to something more wary and uncertain. It was in this atmosphere 
that the Wave 4 Asian Barometer survey entered the field.

[^fn_culture_dialogue]: @Morgenbesser2017-so; @Noren-Nilsson2019-ck. On 
the broader pattern of managed political openings in dominant-party systems, 
see @Schedler2013-qn [The Politics of Uncertainty].

## STUB 8: Political interest and media in W4
## Location: "The Reckoning" section, after the corruption paragraph

The informational dimensions of political life registered the earliest 
signs of the withdrawal that would accelerate dramatically by 2021. 
Political interest declined from 2.57 to 2.29, and following political 
news fell from 3.07 to 2.86—modest drops in absolute terms, but 
significant as the leading edge of a trend that would deepen sharply. 
Political discussion held essentially flat at 1.47, suggesting that 
Cambodians were beginning to disengage from formal political information 
channels while maintaining informal conversational patterns. The internet 
news measure, as noted, dropped precipitously from 5.78 to 2.17, but 
the probable methodological discontinuity between waves makes this 
variable unreliable as an indicator of real-world change in this 
specific transition.

## STUB 9: 2017 dissolution and media crackdown
## Location: "The Silence" section, after the opening paragraph

The CNRP's dissolution did not occur in isolation. It was the centerpiece 
of a broader campaign of political closure that systematically dismantled 
the infrastructure of independent civic life. The *Cambodia Daily*, the 
country's most prominent English-language newspaper and a persistent thorn 
in the CPP's side, was forced to close in September 2017 after receiving 
a disputed tax bill of $6.3 million.[^fn_media_crackdown] Radio Free Asia's 
Cambodian bureau was shuttered, and several of its journalists faced 
criminal charges. Independent radio stations that had broadcast opposition 
content were pressured to switch to pro-government programming or cease 
operations entirely. Civil society organizations faced intensified 
regulatory scrutiny under the 2015 Law on Associations and Non-Governmental 
Organizations (LANGO), which gave the government broad discretionary power 
to dissolve organizations deemed to threaten public order.[^fn_lango]

The combined effect was the elimination not merely of the political 
opposition but of the broader ecosystem—media, civil society, informal 
networks—through which citizens had accessed alternative political 
information and organized collective action. The transition, in Levitsky 
and Way's typology, was from competitive authoritarianism, in which 
opposition parties exist and can occasionally win, to hegemonic 
authoritarianism, in which the electoral arena is formally maintained 
but substantively emptied.[^fn_hegemonic] The 2018 national election, 
conducted without the CNRP on the ballot, produced a CPP sweep of all 
125 National Assembly seats—a result that formalized what the dissolution 
had already accomplished.

[^fn_media_crackdown]: The Cambodia Daily's closure was widely interpreted 
as politically motivated. See @Noren-Nilsson2021-is on the restructuring 
of Cambodia's media landscape during this period.

[^fn_lango]: On LANGO and its effects on civil society space, see 
@Noren-Nilsson2020-ev.

[^fn_hegemonic]: @Levitsky2010-bc; @Schedler2002-eg. @Morgenbesser2019-mb 
applies this framework specifically to Cambodia's post-2017 trajectory.

## STUB 10: Wedeen/normalization paragraph
## Location: "The Silence" section, after the normalization/legitimation distinction

The normalization framework finds a useful analogue in Wedeen's analysis 
of political compliance in Hafez al-Assad's Syria, where citizens 
participated in elaborate public rituals of regime praise not because 
they believed the regime's claims but because acting as if they believed 
was the condition of ordinary life.[^fn_wedeen] The Cambodian case differs 
in important respects—the ABS data capture private survey responses rather 
than public performances, and the CPP's demands on citizens are less 
theatrically extravagant than the Assad cult of personality. But the 
underlying logic is similar: when the political field is restructured so 
that only one arrangement appears viable, citizens adjust their expressed 
orientations to accommodate that arrangement, not out of conviction but 
out of a practical reckoning with the available reality. The survey data 
cannot definitively distinguish between genuine preference change and 
adaptive accommodation, but the pattern of evidence—modest rather than 
dramatic shifts in authoritarian acceptance, coinciding with collapsing 
democratic expectations and civic withdrawal—is more consistent with 
normalization than with conversion.

[^fn_wedeen]: @Wedeen1998-qz; @Wedeen2000-bg. Wedeen's concept of 
"acting as if" captures the performative dimension of political compliance 
under conditions where genuine belief is neither required nor expected 
by the regime.

## STUB 11: Social desirability bias paragraph
## Location: "The Silence" section, after the corruption-demobilization paragraph

An alternative, and not mutually exclusive, explanation for the corruption 
decline invokes the survey environment itself. In a political climate 
where the opposition has been criminalized and independent media shuttered, 
respondents may reasonably calculate that acknowledging witnessed corruption 
—even in a nominally confidential survey—carries risks of self-incrimination 
or unwanted official attention. The social desirability bias literature has 
long recognized that survey responses on sensitive topics shift in 
predictable directions under conditions of political constraint, with 
respondents offering answers that align with perceived official 
expectations.[^fn_sdb] The post-2017 Cambodian environment, in which 
public criticism of the government carried tangible legal consequences, 
represents precisely the conditions under which such bias would be 
expected to intensify. The two explanations—reduced exposure through 
demobilization and increased reticence through social desirability 
pressure—likely operate in tandem, each reinforcing the other to produce 
the dramatic decline observed in the data.

[^fn_sdb]: On social desirability bias in authoritarian survey contexts, 
see Schedler and Sarsfield's work on survey reliability under electoral 
authoritarianism [@Schedler2007-pv]. [NOTE: Jeff, you might also cite 
Frye et al. (2017) "Is Putin's Popularity Real?" or similar — check 
your bib for survey methodology under authoritarianism references.]

---

## STUB 12: China perceptions paragraph
## Location: "The Silence" section, after the voter turnout paragraph

The international orientation data add a final dimension to the 
normalization portrait. Cambodian assessments of Chinese influence in 
the region grew more positive between Waves 4 and 6, rising from 2.69 
to 2.88 on a four-point scale measuring perceived benefit versus harm. 
More striking still, expectations of future Asian—implicitly Chinese—
regional influence climbed from 2.74 in Wave 4 to 3.30 in Wave 6, a 
trajectory that places Cambodia among the most China-positive publics 
in the ABS dataset. This is consistent with Cambodia's deepening 
alignment with Beijing during this period, visible in Belt and Road 
infrastructure investment, the Ream Naval Base controversy, and 
Cambodia's consistent support for Chinese positions within ASEAN. But 
it also fits the normalization logic: as democratic futures recede and 
Western-aligned political alternatives are eliminated, alignment with 
the ascendant authoritarian power in the region becomes the natural 
orientation of a population adjusting to the available political 
reality. A paired comparison with Vietnam or the Philippines—where 
territorial disputes drive China perceptions in sharply negative 
directions despite similar economic interdependence—would sharpen 
this point considerably.[^fn_china]

[^fn_china]: @Strangio2020-gw provides the most comprehensive account 
of Cambodia's positioning within China's Southeast Asian strategy. On 
the divergent China perception trajectories across ASEAN, the ABS 
cross-national data offer direct comparative evidence. [NOTE: Jeff, 
this could connect to your Vietnam Paradox paper — worth a forward 
reference if you're comfortable signaling the broader research agenda.]

---

## STUB 13: Media and political interest in W6
## Location: "The Silence" section, after the China paragraph

The informational withdrawal that began tentatively in 2015 reached 
its full expression by 2021. Following political news fell to 2.04, 
political interest declined to 2.06, and political discussion dropped 
to 1.26—the lowest values recorded across all four waves. These 
figures describe a population that has not merely withdrawn from 
political action but has largely ceased to attend to political 
information at all. The self-reinforcing logic is straightforward: 
citizens who do not participate have less reason to follow political 
developments; citizens who do not follow political developments have 
less basis on which to participate. Demobilization, once initiated 
through the removal of the political alternative, generates its own 
sustaining momentum through this informational feedback loop—a dynamic 
that suggests the effects of the CNRP's dissolution may prove more 
durable than the act itself.
