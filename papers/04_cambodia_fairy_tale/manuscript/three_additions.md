# Three Additional Paragraphs for "The Education of a Citizenry"


## 1. Non-Response as Evidence (insert in Discussion or Conclusion)

A methodological caution is warranted regarding the 63 percent non-response rate on the democratic future item in Wave 6. This level of missingness means that the reported 2021 mean is effectively a survivor statistic, reflecting only those respondents who retained enough political engagement — or perhaps political imagination — to formulate an expectation about Cambodia's democratic trajectory at all. Yet this limitation is also, in a sense, the study's most striking finding. If demobilization by subtraction operates by narrowing the horizon of political possibility, then the inability or unwillingness of nearly two-thirds of respondents to venture an opinion about Cambodia's democratic future is not merely a data problem to be corrected; it is the condition the framework predicts. The silence of the 63 percent and the diminished expectations of the 37 percent who answered are not competing narratives but complementary expressions of the same process. The former have disengaged from the question entirely; the latter have revised their answer downward. Both constitute evidence of a citizenry educated out of democratic expectation, albeit through different registers of withdrawal.


## 2. External Corruption Evidence (insert in Section on Corruption, after the "citizens stopped looking" argument)

External assessments corroborate the interpretation that declining witnessed corruption reflects perceptual withdrawal rather than actual improvement. Cambodia's score on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index remained essentially flat throughout the study period, moving from 21 in 2015 to 23 in 2021 on a 100-point scale — consistently ranking the country among the most corrupt in Southeast Asia and globally (Transparency International 2022). Reports from domestic and international monitoring organizations continued to document endemic corruption in land concessions, public procurement, and the judiciary throughout the period in which survey respondents' reported witnessing of corruption collapsed from 63 to 15 percent. The gap between external expert assessments, which registered no meaningful improvement, and citizens' reported experience, which registered a fourfold decline, is difficult to reconcile with genuine anti-corruption progress. It is, however, consistent with a population that has progressively withdrawn from the administrative and political sites where corruption is encountered — not because corruption diminished, but because the reasons and opportunities for engaging with state institutions outside officially sanctioned channels have.


## 3. Civil Servant Contact as Strategic Adaptation (insert in Section 1.1.4 or Discussion of participation patterns)

The rise in civil servant contact to 37.2 percent in Wave 6, against the backdrop of collapsing independent engagement, warrants careful interpretation. This pattern need not reflect passive acquiescence alone. In a political environment where opposition parties, independent media, and civil society organizations have been systematically dismantled, contacting a civil servant may represent the only remaining channel through which citizens can address grievances or secure material needs. The education of a citizenry, in this sense, involves not only the lowering of democratic expectations but also a pragmatic recalibration of political strategy: citizens learn which levers still function and redirect their efforts accordingly. This reading preserves a degree of agency within the normalization framework — demobilized citizens are not necessarily inert, but their participation has been redirected into channels that reinforce rather than challenge the regime's institutional architecture. The result is a form of engagement that is simultaneously rational at the individual level and depoliticizing at the collective level.
