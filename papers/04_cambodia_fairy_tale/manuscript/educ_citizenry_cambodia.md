Abstract
Between 2008 and 2021, Cambodian citizens underwent one of the most dramatic transformations in political orientation recorded in contemporary survey research. Drawing on four waves of Asian Barometer Survey data (Waves 2, 3, 4, and 6; N ≈ 1,000–1,242 per wave), this article traces the arc of that transformation as a sequential process: from post-conflict acquiescence, through a remarkable peak of democratic aspiration and civic mobilization, to a final condition of political withdrawal and regime normalization following the elimination of organized opposition. The Cambodian case offers an unusually clean empirical window into how dominant-party authoritarian regimes produce political quiescence—not through the cultivation of enthusiastic support, but through a process the article terms demobilization by subtraction, in which the removal of credible democratic alternatives restructures citizen orientations across multiple attitudinal and behavioral dimensions simultaneously. The findings challenge accounts that treat authoritarian legitimacy as a product of performance or ideology, suggesting instead that the most effective mechanism of regime stabilization may be the systematic closure of the political imagination.

### Introduction

In 2012, Cambodians rated the democratic future of their country at 9.6 out of 10.

It is worth pausing on that number. On a scale designed to capture the full range of democratic expectation, Cambodian respondents placed themselves at the extreme ceiling—more optimistic about their democratic trajectory than citizens of virtually any other country surveyed by the Asian Barometer. This was not a country with free and fair elections, an independent judiciary, or a vibrant free press. It was a dominant-party authoritarian state under the continuous rule of Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), a regime that had held power since 1985 and showed no signs of voluntary departure. And yet Cambodians believed, overwhelmingly and almost unanimously, that democracy was coming.

Nine years later, that same measure had fallen to 6.7 out of 10. In the same period, every indicator of political participation in the Asian Barometer Survey—contacting elected officials, signing petitions, attending demonstrations, discussing politics with others—had collapsed to historic lows. Acceptance of authoritarian governance alternatives, including strongman rule, single-party rule, expert rule, and military rule, had risen sharply. Reported encounters with corruption had plummeted from 63 percent to 15 percent. And voter turnout in national elections, now conducted without any viable opposition, had paradoxically climbed to nearly 90 percent.
What happened in between is the subject of this article. The answer, stated plainly, is that the Cambodian People's Party dissolved the only credible opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), in November 2017, and in doing so restructured the political field so thoroughly that Cambodian citizens adjusted their attitudes, behaviors, and expectations in a remarkably coherent pattern. This article argues that this adjustment is best understood not as a story of authoritarian consolidation in the conventional sense—not as the triumph of ideology, coercion, or performance legitimacy—but as something quieter and, in its way, more profound: the education of a citizenry in the limits of the politically possible.

The article proceeds as a structured analytic narrative, organized around the four survey waves as acts in a political drama. This is a deliberate methodological choice. Cambodia's trajectory between 2008 and 2021 has the unusual property of being both analytically tractable—the survey data capture discrete moments in a well-documented political sequence—and narratively coherent, with each wave mapping onto a distinct phase of political life. The narrative structure allows the article to preserve the temporal dynamics that conventional cross-sectional analysis tends to flatten, while the survey data anchor the story in systematic evidence rather than impressionistic accounts.

Key distinction: most of this literature focuses on how regimes survive; this article focuses on what happens to citizens when the democratic alternative is removed.]
[STUB: Paragraph on the concept of "demobilization by subtraction" as the article's theoretical contribution. Not repression-driven demobilization (Davenport, Earl), not co-optation (Gandhi, Przeworski), but the withdrawal of the object around which mobilization organized. The mechanism is closer to Lukes' third face of power or Gaventa's quiescence—but observable across multiple survey dimensions simultaneously.]

### The Quiet Kingdom: Cambodia in 2008
The first act of this story is a silence, and it is important to understand what kind of silence it was.
By 2008, Cambodia had been under continuous CPP rule for over two decades. The Paris Peace Accords of 1991 and the UNTAC-supervised elections of 1993 had produced a brief, chaotic experiment in multiparty democracy, but the CPP had never genuinely relinquished power, and after a violent coup in 1997 and disputed elections in 1998 and 2003, the party had consolidated its dominance through a combination of patronage, institutional control, and selective coercion. The 2008 National Assembly elections, which the CPP won with 58 of 123 seats and subsequently expanded through coalition politics, were competitive in form but not seriously contested in outcome.

[STUB: 1-2 paragraphs on the political context of 2008 Cambodia—CPP structure, patronage networks, the Sam Rainsy Party as fragmented opposition, the legacy of the Khmer Rouge tribunal era, economic growth under the garment sector and construction boom.]

The Wave 2 Asian Barometer data from this period paint a portrait of a population that was neither enthusiastic nor resistant, but simply quiet. Political participation measures hovered at modest levels: contacting elected officials averaged 3.44 on a five-point scale (where 5 represents frequent contact), and contacting civil servants registered at 3.43—neither disengaged nor actively engaged, but somewhere in the unremarkable middle. Community leader contact stood at 1.53, suggesting that local political networks, while present, were not sites of intensive citizen activity.

[STUB: Table 1 — Wave 2 baseline values across all five thematic domains: participation, authoritarian attitudes, democratic expectations, corruption, media/political interest.]

The authoritarian attitude measures are perhaps the most telling. Single-party rule was rated at 1.79 on a four-point scale (where 4 represents "very good"), strongman rule at 1.60, and military rule at 2.19. These are not the numbers of a population that embraces authoritarianism as an ideal; they are the numbers of a population that has learned to live within it. The slightly elevated tolerance for military rule is consistent with the CPP's own origins in Vietnamese-backed military intervention and the residual security anxieties of a post-genocide society, but even this measure sits below the scale midpoint.

What is most notable about the 2008 data, viewed in retrospect, is how stable everything appears. There are no dramatic spikes, no anomalous values, no signs of the upheaval to come. Cambodia in 2008 was a country in political equilibrium—not a democratic equilibrium, but not one characterized by active authoritarian mobilization either. It was, to extend the metaphor, a kingdom in which the subjects had learned that the king was permanent and had arranged their lives accordingly. The question that the next four years would pose, with startling force, was what would happen when that arrangement was briefly, thrillingly disrupted.

### The Awakening: Cambodia in 2012

Something extraordinary happened in Cambodia between 2008 and 2012, and the Wave 3 Asian Barometer data capture its imprint with unusual clarity.

Across nearly every measure of civic engagement and political aspiration, Cambodian respondents in 2012 registered at or near the highest values in the dataset's history. Contacting elected officials jumped from 3.44 to 4.31. Contacting civil servants rose from 3.43 to 4.33. Petition activity climbed to 4.34 (from no W2 baseline but, as subsequent waves would reveal, far above the structural average). Community leader contact increased from 1.53 to 1.90. And the political participation measures that would only be tracked beginning in Wave 3—attending demonstrations (4.48) and signing petitions (4.34)—debuted at remarkably high levels.

These are not the numbers of a quiescent population. They are the numbers of a population that had been politically activated.

The catalyst was the formation of the Cambodia National Rescue Party in 2012, a merger of the Sam Rainsy Party and the Human Rights Party under the joint leadership of Sam Rainsy and Kem Sokha. The CNRP did something that no previous Cambodian opposition had managed: it unified the fragmented non-CPP political space into a single, credible alternative with a coherent message of democratic reform, anti-corruption, and economic justice. The party drew its energy from an emerging urban youth demographic—the first generation of Cambodians born after the Khmer Rouge, educated in the expanding university system, connected to the wider world through social media, and impatient with the political settlement their parents had accepted.

[STUB: 2-3 paragraphs on the CNRP formation, the 2013 election campaign (which technically falls after the W3 survey but whose mobilization dynamics were already visible in 2012), the role of social media and Facebook in Cambodian political mobilization, the demographic shift toward a younger electorate. Key sources: Strangio (2014), Un (2019), Norén-Nilsson (2016).]

The democratic expectation measures tell the same story from a different angle. When asked to rate the democratic future of their country on a ten-point scale, Cambodian respondents in 2012 produced a mean of 9.58. This is, by any standard, an extraordinary number. It is not merely optimistic; it approaches unanimity. It suggests a population that had collectively decided that democratic change was not merely desirable but imminent—that the political order they had lived under for decades was on the verge of fundamental transformation.

The paradox, of course, is that this expectation was not based on any structural change in the regime. The CPP still controlled the state apparatus, the military, the courts, the media, and the vast patronage networks that sustained its rural base. Hun Sen showed no inclination to reform or retire. What had changed was not the regime but the perception of the regime's permanence—and that perceptual shift, as the subsequent waves would demonstrate, proved far more fragile than the political moment suggested.

[STUB: Paragraph on the democratic assessment triad—past (3.97), present (5.85), future (9.58)—and what the specific configuration tells us. The past is rated low (the Khmer Rouge and post-conflict chaos), the present is middling (recognizing current limitations), but the future is stratospheric. This is the signature of a hope-driven rather than experience-driven democratic orientation.]

Even the corruption data reflect the mobilization moment. Witnessed corruption stood at 49.4 percent in Wave 3, up from 27.7 percent in Wave 2. This increase is almost certainly not an increase in actual corruption—the CPP's patronage system was well-established long before 2012—but rather reflects a population that had become more willing to identify and report corruption as a political problem, emboldened by the opposition's anti-corruption messaging and the expanded civic space that accompanied the CNRP's rise.

There are also subtler patterns in the Wave 3 data that resist easy interpretation. Traditional values measures—obedience to parents, deference to teacher authority—also peaked in this wave, an unexpected finding given that the broader mobilization was associated with youth activism and challenges to established authority. One possibility is that the CNRP's own messaging, which blended democratic aspiration with Khmer cultural conservatism and Buddhist moral frameworks, activated traditional values alongside rather than in opposition to democratic ones. Another is that the elevated values reflect a general intensification of political and social engagement in which all expressed attitudes, whether progressive or traditional, registered at higher levels. A third possibility, which cannot be ruled out, is survey context effects: the charged political environment of 2012 may have produced a general social desirability bias toward expressing strong opinions of any kind.

[STUB: Brief paragraph on media consumption and political interest in W3—political interest at 2.57, news following at 3.07, the highest levels in the dataset. Note the internet news anomaly (5.78) that may reflect a scale change rather than a real value.]

The 2012 data, taken together, present a portrait of a political community at its moment of maximum activation. Every dimension the Asian Barometer measures—participation, aspiration, attention, even the willingness to name corruption—points in the same direction. It is tempting, with the knowledge of what came after, to read this as the high-water mark of Cambodian democracy, the moment before the tide turned. But that reading, while emotionally satisfying, may be too simple. What the Wave 3 data may actually capture is something rarer and more theoretically interesting: the moment when a population collectively updated its beliefs about what was politically possible, before the regime demonstrated, with devastating effectiveness, that those beliefs were wrong.

### The Reckoning: Cambodia in 2015

The 2013 national election, held just months after the Wave 3 survey, confirmed the CNRP's mobilization power in spectacular fashion. The opposition won 55 seats to the CPP's 68—the closest result in Cambodian electoral history. The CNRP disputed the results, alleging fraud, and organized mass protests in Phnom Penh that drew tens of thousands. For several months, the country appeared to teeter on the edge of genuine political change.

It did not come.

[STUB: 2-3 paragraphs on the post-2013 election crisis—CNRP boycott of parliament, the January 2014 crackdown on garment worker protests (with fatalities), the eventual Sam Rainsy-Hun Sen deal of July 2014 that brought the CNRP into parliament, the Culture of Dialogue period, and its gradual erosion through 2015-2016. Sources: LICADHO reports, Morgenbesser (2019), Strangio (2020).]

The Wave 4 data from 2015 capture a population in the midst of this reckoning—no longer at the peak of mobilization but not yet in the trough of withdrawal. The numbers tell a story of selective retreat. Contacting elected officials fell from 4.31 to 3.08. Contacting civil servants dropped from 4.33 to 3.19. Demonstration attendance declined from 4.48 to 3.07, and petition activity from 4.34 to 3.23. Community leader contact, however, held relatively steady at 2.00, suggesting that local-level political networks remained more resilient than national-level civic action.

[STUB: Table 2 — Wave 3 to Wave 4 comparison across all domains, with change values.]

The retreat from participation was not yet accompanied by a corresponding rise in authoritarian acceptance. Single-party rule actually dipped slightly from 1.97 to 1.78, and military rule fell from 2.19 to 1.98. Expert rule and strongman rule edged up marginally but remained below 2.0. This pattern is analytically important: it suggests that the demobilization observed between 2012 and 2015 was driven more by disillusionment and tactical withdrawal than by a genuine reorientation toward authoritarian preferences. Cambodians were pulling back from political action, but they had not yet accepted the authoritarian order as normatively appropriate.

The democratic expectation measures, however, had already begun their descent. The democratic future rating fell from 9.58 to 7.72—a drop of nearly two full points on the ten-point scale. The democratic present, as assessed through government performance, declined from 5.85 to 5.06. Only the democratic past held relatively steady at 3.87. What this configuration suggests is that the hope that had animated the 2012 moment was already eroding, not because Cambodians had embraced an alternative vision, but because the events of 2013-2014—the election that changed nothing, the protests that were suppressed, the deal that left the CPP in power—had begun to teach a lesson about the limits of popular mobilization within a dominant-party system.

The corruption data from Wave 4 introduce a striking counterpoint. Witnessed corruption surged to its highest level in the dataset: 62.8 percent of respondents reported having personally encountered corruption. This was not an artifact of increased willingness to report; the political environment of 2015 was, if anything, less permissive of anti-government speech than 2012. The more likely explanation is that the post-2013 period, with its political bargaining, institutional jockeying, and expanded CNRP presence in parliament, created more visible sites of corruption—more interactions between citizens and competing political actors, more opportunities to observe the transactional nature of Cambodian governance up close.

[STUB: Paragraph on the political interest and media measures in W4—modest declines (interest from 2.57 to 2.29, news from 3.07 to 2.86) suggesting the beginning of informational withdrawal. The internet news collapse (5.78 to 2.17) needs the methodological caveat about possible question wording changes.]

The 2015 wave, viewed within the larger narrative, represents the hinge point—the moment when the trajectory could still have gone either way. The CNRP was weakened but present, its leaders alternately accommodated and harassed, its supporters disillusioned but not yet defeated. The data register this ambiguity: down from the peaks of 2012 but not yet at the floor. Participation was retreating but authoritarian acceptance had not yet risen. Democratic hope was falling but had not crashed. Corruption was more visible than ever. It was a moment of unstable equilibrium, poised between the democratic aspiration of 2012 and the authoritarian normalization that was about to descend.

### The Silence: Cambodia in 2021

On November 16, 2017, the Supreme Court of Cambodia dissolved the Cambodia National Rescue Party. The ruling, which cited a vaguely defined conspiracy to overthrow the government, banned 118 CNRP officials from political activity for five years and transferred the party's parliamentary seats to smaller, CPP-aligned parties. Kem Sokha had already been arrested in September; Sam Rainsy remained in exile. In the July 2018 national election, the CPP won all 125 seats in the National Assembly. Cambodia became, for all practical purposes, a one-party state.

[STUB: 2-3 paragraphs on the 2017 dissolution—legal mechanisms, international response, the crackdown on independent media (Cambodia Daily closure, RFA journalists arrested), the civil society squeeze, and the 2018 election. Note the regime's shift from competitive authoritarianism to hegemonic authoritarianism in Levitsky & Way's typology.]

The Wave 6 data from 2021 record the consequences.

The participation collapse is the most dramatic finding. Contacting elected officials fell to 1.74—a drop from 4.31 in 2012 and 3.08 in 2015, representing one of the steepest declines in civic participation recorded in the Asian Barometer dataset. Demonstration attendance crashed to 1.29, barely above the theoretical floor. Petition activity fell to 2.14. Contacting civil servants dropped to 2.47. Even community leader contact, which had been the most resilient participation measure, fell to 1.39. Political discussion, already low, declined to 1.26—a population that had largely stopped talking about politics with one another.

[STUB: Table 3 — Full four-wave trajectory across all domains. This is the key empirical table of the paper.]

The authoritarian acceptance measures moved in mirror image. All four alternative governance indicators rose to their highest levels: expert rule to 2.11, single-party rule to 2.21, strongman rule to 2.17, and military rule to 2.21. The jump was concentrated entirely in the W4-to-W6 period—the six years that encompassed the CNRP's destruction and the subsequent one-party election. What had been stable or declining through 2015 now surged.

There is an important interpretive question here, and the article's argument depends on how it is answered. Does the rise in authoritarian acceptance represent genuine preference change—Cambodians coming to believe that authoritarian governance is normatively desirable—or does it represent something else? Three considerations suggest the latter. First, the magnitude of the shift, while statistically meaningful, is modest in absolute terms: all four measures remain around 2.2 on a four-point scale, below the midpoint. Cambodians are not rating authoritarianism as "good"; they are rating it as slightly less bad than before. Second, the timing—concentrated after the removal of the democratic alternative—suggests a mechanism closer to adaptive preference formation than genuine conversion. Third, and most importantly, the shift co-occurs with the collapse of democratic future expectations (from 7.72 to 6.67), rising perceptions of government information withholding, and declining political interest. This is not the attitudinal profile of a population that has found a new political faith; it is the profile of a population that has stopped believing the old one was achievable.

The article proposes the term authoritarian normalization to describe this process, distinguishing it from authoritarian legitimation. Legitimation implies that citizens have come to view the regime as rightfully entitled to rule, whether on the basis of performance, ideology, or tradition. Normalization implies something weaker but potentially more durable: citizens have come to view the regime as the only available reality and have adjusted their expressed preferences to align with that reality. The distinction matters theoretically because it suggests different mechanisms of regime stability—and different vulnerabilities. A regime sustained by legitimation is threatened when performance falters or ideology loses appeal. A regime sustained by normalization is threatened when alternatives re-enter the political imagination.

[STUB: Paragraph developing the normalization concept with reference to Wedeen (1999) on Syria—"acting as if" as a mode of political compliance. Also Schedler's work on the "menu of manipulation" and how removing opposition changes the choice architecture facing citizens.]

The corruption data offer perhaps the most unsettling evidence of normalization. Witnessed corruption collapsed from 62.8 percent in 2015 to 14.9 percent in 2021. Perceived national government corruption also declined, from 2.90 to 2.33 on the four-point scale. On the surface, these numbers might suggest genuine anti-corruption progress. The CPP did conduct selective anti-corruption campaigns during this period, targeting rivals and politically inconvenient officials. But the magnitude of the witnessed-corruption decline—from nearly two-thirds to one-seventh of the population—is too large to explain through policy alone.

The more parsimonious explanation is that the corruption decline reflects the same demobilization process visible in the participation data. When citizens withdraw from political life—when they stop contacting officials, stop attending meetings, stop engaging with governance institutions—they also reduce their exposure to the sites where corruption is experienced and observed. A population that does not petition, does not demonstrate, and does not contact civil servants is also a population that has fewer occasions to witness a bribe demanded or a favor exchanged. Demobilization, in this reading, does not merely reduce political action; it reduces the perceptual evidence that political action might address. The regime becomes less corrupt not because it has reformed but because citizens have stopped looking.

[STUB: Alternative explanation—social desirability bias. In a more repressive environment, respondents may be less willing to report witnessing corruption for fear of implicating themselves or attracting official attention. The two explanations are not mutually exclusive and may reinforce each other.]

The voter turnout paradox completes the portrait. Despite the collapse of all other forms of political participation, self-reported voting in the last election rose from 78.7 percent in 2012 to 83.2 percent in 2015 to 88.1 percent in 2021. This pattern—rising electoral participation amid collapsing civic participation—is a well-documented feature of hegemonic authoritarian systems, where elections serve not as mechanisms of political choice but as rituals of regime affirmation. Voting in a one-party election is not a political act in the same sense as voting in a competitive one; it is closer to a demonstration of compliance, a public performance of belonging to the political community as the regime defines it. The fact that turnout rises precisely as meaningful participation collapses suggests that Cambodians understand the distinction even as they perform the ritual.

[STUB: Paragraph on China perceptions—rising positive views of Chinese influence (2.69 to 2.88), rising expectation of Asian/Chinese regional dominance (2.41 to 3.30). This fits the normalization thesis: as democratic futures recede, alignment with the rising authoritarian power in the region becomes more natural. Brief comparison with Vietnam and Philippines, where China perceptions move in opposite directions.]

[STUB: Paragraph on media and political interest—news following down to 2.04, political interest to 2.06, political discussion to 1.26. The informational withdrawal completes the demobilization circuit: citizens who do not participate also stop paying attention, which further reduces the likelihood of future participation. This is the self-reinforcing logic of demobilization.]

The Cambodia of 2021 is, in a sense, the inverse of the Cambodia of 2012. Where the earlier moment was characterized by activation across all dimensions—participation, aspiration, attention, even the willingness to name corruption—the later moment is characterized by withdrawal across all the same dimensions. The symmetry is striking and, for the theoretical argument, essential. It suggests that what changed between the two moments was not any single attitude or behavior but the underlying orientation from which attitudes and behaviors derive—what might be called the perceived horizon of political possibility. When that horizon expanded, everything expanded with it. When it contracted, everything contracted.

### The Education

[STUB: This is the theoretical discussion section, structured as the conclusion of the narrative rather than a separate analytical appendix.]

The story told in the preceding pages is, in one sense, particular to Cambodia—a product of specific historical circumstances, a specific regime, a specific opposition movement, and a specific act of political closure. In another sense, it is a story with much wider application, because the mechanism it illustrates—the restructuring of citizen orientations through the removal of political alternatives—operates wherever dominant-party regimes consolidate power.

[STUB: 3-4 paragraphs developing the theoretical implications:

The concept of "demobilization by subtraction" — how it differs from repression-driven demobilization (citizens are not primarily afraid; they have recalibrated) and co-optation (citizens are not primarily bought off; they have withdrawn). The key mechanism is the contraction of perceived possibility, which cascades across behavioral and attitudinal dimensions simultaneously.

The relationship between hope and democratic attitudes — the W3 data suggest that democratic support in authoritarian contexts may be driven less by abstract values than by perceived feasibility. When democracy appeared possible (2012), every democratic indicator surged. When it appeared impossible (2021), they collapsed. This has implications for the "democratic values" literature: measured democratic attitudes may be more situationally contingent than the literature assumes.

The corruption-visibility nexus — the finding that corruption witnessed declines with demobilization suggests that anti-corruption campaigns in authoritarian contexts need to be evaluated against a baseline that accounts for citizen withdrawal. A regime that demobilizes its population will appear less corrupt by survey measures even if actual corruption is unchanged.

The voter turnout paradox as diagnostic — the divergence between electoral participation (rising) and civic participation (collapsing) may serve as a useful indicator of authoritarian normalization across cases. Where this pattern appears, it signals the transformation of elections from competitive mechanisms to compliance rituals.]

[STUB: 1-2 paragraphs on limitations—only four waves, COVID-19 effects on W6, the W3 peak may reflect survey timing rather than structural change, single-country case limits generalizability. However, the within-case temporal variation is the study's strength: the same population, measured at four moments across a well-documented political sequence.]

[STUB: 1-2 paragraphs on comparative implications—where else might demobilization by subtraction be observable? Turkey after the HDP crackdown? Russia after the Navalny organization was banned? Hungary's opposition fragmentation? The ABS dataset itself offers comparison cases: Thailand's post-coup trajectory, the Philippines under Duterte. Future research could test whether the demobilization sequence observed in Cambodia—participation collapse → authoritarian acceptance rise → democratic aspiration decline—follows a consistent temporal ordering across cases.]

This article began with a number: 9.6 out of 10. It is worth ending with the question of what that number meant. In 2012, Cambodian citizens looked at their country—a dominant-party authoritarian state with controlled media, a compromised judiciary, and a history of political violence—and saw a democratic future so bright they could barely imagine anything brighter. Nine years later, they had learned otherwise. The democratic future had not arrived. The party that promised it had been dissolved. The leaders who championed it were in prison or exile. And the population, having briefly imagined a different political life, had returned to the quiet arrangement their parents had known—participating in elections that offered no choice, accepting governance structures they had once rejected, and gradually, measurably, ceasing to pay attention.

The fairy tale has no happy ending. But it has a lesson, and the lesson is not about Cambodia alone. It is about the fragility of democratic aspiration in the absence of democratic infrastructure, and about the remarkable efficiency with which authoritarian regimes can reshape citizen orientations simply by removing the object around which those orientations had formed. The education of Cambodia's citizenry between 2008 and 2021 was not accomplished through indoctrination or ideology. It was accomplished through subtraction—the removal of an alternative, and the long silence that followed.
