# Discussion

The central finding of this article is not that electoral losers prefer procedural democracy — though they do, consistently, across twenty items and eleven countries. The finding that matters is that this preference *moves*. Thailand's trajectory from near-zero to over twenty percentage points across a single decade of democratic erosion cannot be reconciled with accounts treating democratic conceptions as stable cultural inheritances or fixed psychological dispositions [@Norris2011-zt; @Inglehart1997-gw]. Nor is it plausibly compositional: Thailand's color-coded partisan alignments remained remarkably stable even as the parties themselves were repeatedly dissolved and reconstituted [@Sinpeng2021-hd; @McCargo2019-rx]. Citizens updated their understanding of what democracy fundamentally means in response to changes in the political stakes of losing — the pattern predicted by the positional updating account and confirmed by the fairness interaction results, which show that the loser effect intensifies precisely among those who perceive elections as compromised.

This dynamic carries a troubling implication for the study of democratic resilience. A growing literature asks whether mass public support for democracy can serve as a bulwark against backsliding [@Claassen2020-hk; @Svolik2019-zi; @Graham2020-jr]. The present results suggest a structural problem with this expectation: where erosion is most severe, procedural commitments become concentrated among those whom the political system has rendered least capable of defending them. Aggregate measures of democratic support may therefore overstate resilience by averaging across winners whose procedural commitments are shallow and losers whose commitments are deep but politically ineffectual. The mechanisms through which democracies erode — executive aggrandizement, judicial capture, media suppression [@Levitsky2018-dd; @Waldner2018-yw; @Luhrmann2019-ow] — are precisely the mechanisms that disarm the constituency most committed to procedural norms. Whether losers' procedural orientation can translate into effective resistance, through protest, civil disobedience, or transnational advocacy, remains an open and urgent question.

The results also complicate the winner-loser gap literature in a way that has implications for survey research. Previous work has assumed that winners and losers share a common understanding of democracy when they report their satisfaction with it or their trust in its institutions [@Anderson2005-uk; @Esaiasson2011-po; @Norris2012-wj]. If winners and losers define democracy differently — winners emphasizing outcomes, losers emphasizing procedures — then the standard "satisfaction with democracy" question is not measuring the same thing for both groups. Losers may report dissatisfaction because they perceive procedural violations; winners may report satisfaction because they perceive policy delivery. This disconnect suggests that the much-studied winner-loser gap in democratic satisfaction may partly reflect a *measurement* artifact: not different evaluations of the same object, but evaluations of different objects.

The item-level results add a further dimension. The loser effect is not a generic procedural orientation but a specifically *liberal-democratic* one. Losers gravitate toward media freedom, free expression, the right to organize, and judicial accountability — the institutional infrastructure that sustains political opposition — rather than toward elections per se. This pattern, reinforced by the negative interaction between loser status and perceived electoral fairness on the free elections item, suggests that electoral experience teaches losers a nuanced lesson: the value of democracy lies not in the electoral mechanism that has failed them but in the broader liberal ecosystem that preserves the possibility of contestation. The distinction between electoral and liberal conceptions of procedural democracy, latent in theoretical frameworks from @Dahl1971-lu to @Schedler1998-dl, appears to be psychologically real among citizens navigating the consequences of electoral loss.

Finally, the order-versus-contestation tension in the governance items deserves further investigation. Winners' strong preference for law and order as a defining feature of democracy, combined with losers' emphasis on civil liberties and accountability, captures a fault line that @Slater2010-ba has identified as central to the politics of order in Southeast Asia. Where democratic institutions are robust, the demands for order and for contestation coexist in productive tension. Where they are not, the two conceptions may become mutually exclusive — and in the current period of global democratic recession [@Diamond2015-yb; @Foa2016-lq], understanding which conception prevails, and among whom, has consequences well beyond the region studied here.

Several limitations temper these conclusions. The analysis relies on repeated cross-sections rather than panel data, precluding direct observation of individual-level attitude change; the within-country trajectories are suggestive but not definitive. The sample comprises only eleven countries, limiting cross-national inference. The Wave 6 compression across most countries outside Thailand remains incompletely explained, though the COVID-19 pandemic's homogenizing effect on the salience of state capacity is a plausible contributor — a prediction that post-pandemic survey waves will be positioned to test. And the exclusion of non-voters, while theoretically motivated, means the findings characterize the politically engaged electorate rather than the population at large.

# Conclusion

This article has shown that electoral status shapes not merely citizens' satisfaction with democracy but their understanding of what democracy fundamentally means. Losers prioritize the liberal-procedural infrastructure — free expression, media freedom, judicial accountability, the right to organize — that sustains the possibility of political contestation. Winners prioritize substantive outcomes and the governance of order. This divergence is not a reflection of stable values but a positional response to the political stakes of exclusion, as the dramatic within-country trajectories in Thailand and South Korea demonstrate.

The most consequential implication is structural. Democratic erosion does not merely reduce the quality of governance or diminish civil liberties; it reshapes the very meaning of democracy along the winner-loser divide, concentrating procedural commitments among those least able to act on them. If the positional logic holds beyond Asia — a question that comparative research in Latin America and Africa is well positioned to address — then the relationship between public attitudes and democratic resilience may be more fragile than the existing literature suggests. Future research should examine whether losers' procedural orientation translates into distinct patterns of political behavior, particularly unconventional participation, testing whether democratic conceptions serve as blueprints for resistance or remain, ultimately, survey artifacts.
