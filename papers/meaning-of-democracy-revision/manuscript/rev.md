Academic Writing Skill Applied to "The Meaning of Losing"
***Overall Assessment
This is a strong manuscript—well-argued, empirically ambitious, and clearly written. The prose is already substantially above the median for political science submissions. The Thailand–South Korea contrast is compelling, the mechanism tests are well-structured, and the contribution framing has improved dramatically from the earlier draft. What follows is a close reading organized by the academic writing skill's core principles, flagging specific passages where revision would sharpen the prose for JEAS reviewers.
***1. VOICE & REGISTER
Issue: First person usage is inconsistent.
The skill calls for third person throughout (unless co-authored methods), but the manuscript uses first person extensively ("I propose," "I estimate," "I interpret," "I test"). For a single-authored paper in political science, first person is actually standard at JEAS and most comparativist journals, so this is not a problem for submission—the skill's third-person default reflects a convention more common in sociology. No changes needed here; the first-person voice is confident and appropriate.
Issue: Occasional colloquial register.
Several passages dip below the formality expected in a journal article:
| Line | Current | Problem | Suggested |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| ~308 | "a few percentage points here and there" | Colloquial | "individually modest—on the order of two to four percentage points" |
| ~410 | "South Korea's trajectory could hardly be more different" | Slightly journalistic | "South Korea presents a strikingly divergent trajectory" |
| ~459 | "naturally raise the question of why" | Conversational | "raise the question of mechanism" |
| ~495 | "sour grapes dressed up in procedural language" | Too informal for CPS/JEAS | "generalized electoral discontent expressed through procedural vocabulary" |
| ~556 | "This does not rule out realignment along unmeasured dimensions" | Fine, but "This" as sentence opener is imprecise | "The exercise does not rule out..." |
| ~568 | "you would need panel data for that" | Second person, conversational | "establishing individual-level change would require panel data" |
| ~568 | "cultural heirlooms" | Mixed metaphor + typo (should be "heirlooms") | "stable cultural inheritances" |
Line 568 especially reads like a blog post rather than a journal article. The cumulative interpretation paragraph (lines 558–568) is where the manuscript's voice shifts most noticeably toward informality. Consider tightening.
***2. SENTENCE CONSTRUCTION & RHYTHM
Strength: The manuscript already varies sentence length well. Short declarative punches ("This is not a puzzle—it is a coherent response," line 495) alternate with long multi-clause arguments. This is one of the manuscript's best qualities.
Issue: Some paragraphs fall into mid-length monotony.
The methods section (lines 213–225) is the worst offender. Every sentence runs 25–40 words with similar clause structures. Compare:
> "Standard errors are computed via wild cluster bootstrap at the country level, following Cameron et al. (2008). With only eleven country clusters in the pooled sample, conventional cluster-robust variance estimators are known to produce downward-biased standard errors and over-reject the null hypothesis. The wild bootstrap imposes the null hypothesis on the bootstrap data-generating process, providing more reliable inference with few clusters. This approach yields conservative tests throughout the analysis."
Four consecutive sentences of nearly identical length and structure (subordinate clause → main clause). The content is fine; the rhythm needs variation. Suggested revision:
> "Standard errors are computed via wild cluster bootstrap at the country level (Cameron et al. 2008). The rationale is straightforward: with only eleven country clusters, conventional cluster-robust variance estimators are known to produce downward-biased standard errors and over-reject the null. By imposing the null hypothesis on the bootstrap data-generating process, the wild bootstrap provides more reliable inference in precisely these small-cluster settings. Tests throughout the analysis are accordingly conservative."
Short opener, reasoning sentence, longer technical sentence, punchy closer.
***3. TRANSITIONS
Issue: Predictable transitional phrases appear in several places.
| Line | Current transition | Suggested replacement |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| ~150 | "This variation matters because..." | "The stakes of this variation are concrete:" |
| ~154 | "Relatively little work has asked..." | "What remains largely unexplored is..." |
| ~160 | "This literature, however, has focused on..." | "The limitation is one of scope:" |
| ~170 | "An important point:" | "A clarification is in order." |
| ~412 | "Cambodia shows a persistently large gap..." | "Cambodia illuminates a different boundary condition." |
| ~538 | "An important caveat qualifies these findings." | "A qualification is necessary." |
| ~602 | "Several caveats apply." | "The analysis faces limitations worth stating directly." |
The manuscript generally avoids "Furthermore/Moreover/Additionally"—good. But "An important point" (line ~170) and "Several caveats apply" (line ~602) are still filler transitions. Each should carry argumentative weight.
***4. VERB CHOICE
Issue: Over-reliance on "shows," "finds," and "suggests."
The manuscript uses "shows" 8 times, "finds" 6 times, and "suggests" 7 times. The skill calls for more precise academic verbs that convey the nature of the intellectual work. Some specific substitutions:
| Current | Context | Suggested |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| "show that affective polarization in Taiwan erodes support" (line 150) | Hsiao & Yu finding | "demonstrate that affective polarization in Taiwan attenuates support" |
| "finds that the winner-loser gap appears" (line 596) | Rich 2025 | "documents that the winner-loser gap materializes" |
| "suggesting that political position... conditions how citizens relate" (line 150) | Theoretical implication | "indicating that political position... mediates how citizens relate" |
More generally, consider deploying: "corroborates" (for confirming evidence), "complicates" (for findings that add nuance), "isolates" (for mechanism tests), "unsettles" (for findings that challenge existing accounts).
***5. HEDGING & PRECISION
Strength: The hedging is already excellent. The manuscript consistently matches confidence to evidence—"suggests" for cross-sectional patterns, "cannot definitively rule out" for limitations, "tilt toward" for cumulative evidence. The conclusion's "what the evidence does suggest, fairly clearly" (line 610) is a model of calibrated confidence.
Issue: A few passages overclaim relative to the evidence.
| Line | Current | Problem | Suggested |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| ~130 | "This article demonstrates that it does." | "Demonstrates" is too strong for observational data | "This article presents evidence that it does." |
| ~308 | "Winners and losers inhabit measurably different conceptual worlds" | Dramatic for 2–4pp effects | "Winners and losers occupy measurably different positions in the conceptual space of democratic meaning" |
| ~408 | "This trajectory... tracks Thailand's democratic erosion with remarkable precision" | "Remarkable precision" overclaims for three time points | "This trajectory tracks the contours of Thailand's democratic erosion" |
| ~604 | "This article has demonstrated that electoral status is systematically associated" | Strong for conclusion but acceptable given cumulative evidence | Acceptable as-is |
Line 130 is the most important fix. The paper is not in a position to "demonstrate" a causal relationship; "present evidence for" is more appropriate and the JEAS reviewers already flagged language like this.
***6. PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE
Strength: Nearly every paragraph opens with a clear topic sentence. The theory section (lines 146–196) is particularly well-structured—each paragraph does one thing and connects logically to the next.
Issue: Two paragraphs are too long and try to do too much.
Line 310 (free elections paragraph): Currently ~180 words. This paragraph introduces the free elections anomaly, explains it, coins the term "cynical proceduralism," AND connects it to the broader item-level pattern. Consider splitting after "...the loser effect, in other words, is not an elections effect but a liberal-democratic effect." The "cynical proceduralism" concept (line 312) deserves its own short paragraph—it's doing enough conceptual work to warrant separation.
Line 538 (endogeneity caveat): At ~120 words as a single sentence-paragraph, this is fine structurally but the sentence itself is 95 words long. Consider breaking it into two sentences after "collinearity)."
Line 592 (resilience paragraph): At ~140 words, this paragraph packs in: democratic resilience literature, the structural problem, the rosy picture metaphor, AND the bitter irony. This is the paper's most important normative claim. Let it breathe. The "bitter irony" sentence deserves to be a standalone short paragraph for emphasis.
***7. CITATION INTEGRATION
Strength: Citations are generally well-woven. The theory section integrates them naturally (e.g., "just as partisan position shapes whether citizens view the economy favorably [Evans and Fiorina]"). The parenthetical stacking is thematic rather than exhaustive.
Issue: A few citations are stacked without differentiation.
| Line | Current | Suggested |
|------|---------|-----------|
| ~127 | "[@Anderson2005-uk; @Anderson2002-cv; @Esaiasson2011-po]" | These three do different things. Consider: "from satisfaction with democracy [@Anderson2005-uk] to institutional trust [@Anderson2002-cv] to willingness to accept outcomes [@Esaiasson2011-po]" |
| ~592 | "[@Claassen2020-hk; @Svolik2019-zi; @Graham2020-jr]" | "[@Claassen2020-hk; @Svolik2019-zi; @Graham2020-jr]" — This stack appears twice (lines 140 and 592). The second occurrence is fine since these three are now established as a group. But the first occurrence (line 140) could be differentiated. |
Critical gap: As noted in the previous engagement paragraph work, Cohen et al. (2022), Wu & Wu/Chang (2022), and Bryan (2023) are not yet cited anywhere. These are the three closest papers in the literature and their absence is conspicuous. The engagement paragraphs I drafted earlier address this.
***8. METHODOLOGICAL INTENT
Strength: The methods section generally explains why choices are made, not just what was done. The wild cluster bootstrap justification (line 223) and the voter-restriction rationale (line 201) are good examples.
Issue: Two methodological choices lack sufficient motivation.
Line 213: "Rather than collapsing responses into a binary procedural–substantive indicator, the analysis models each item set as a separate multinomial logistic regression, preserving all four response categories within each set."
This states the choice but front-loads the "what" before the "why." Suggested revision: "Collapsing responses into a binary procedural–substantive indicator would sacrifice the item-level heterogeneity that is central to the analysis. Instead, each item set is modeled as a separate multinomial logistic regression, preserving all four response categories."
Line 225: The computation of the procedural–substantive gap is described procedurally but the choice to use this summary measure over alternatives (e.g., individual item-level trajectories) is not justified. A sentence explaining why gap-based tracking is informative for H2/H3 would help.
***9. SPECIFIC LINE-LEVEL EDITS
Introduction
Line 123–124: "It is a story about what citizens came to believe democracy means." → Strong. Keep.
Line 128: "These contrasting trajectories point to a question that two established research literatures have, surprisingly, not addressed together." → The parenthetical "surprisingly" weakens the claim. Either it's surprising (in which case the reader should reach that conclusion themselves) or it's not (in which case the word is filler). Delete "surprisingly."
Line 130: "This article argues that it does." → Currently the next paragraph opens "This article demonstrates that it does." The word "demonstrates" (as noted above) should be softened. But also: "argues" in line 130 and "demonstrates" in the next paragraph create a disjunction—do you argue or demonstrate? Pick one framing. Suggestion: Keep "argues" here, change "demonstrates" to "presents evidence" in the next paragraph.
Lines 134–136 (pooled results paragraph): "In pooled cross-national estimates, these effects are individually small, on the order of two to four percentage points per item. But the pattern holds across twenty items drawn from five separate survey batteries, and that directional consistency is what makes the finding substantively important." → This is excellent—honest about effect sizes while justifying substantive significance. Keep as-is.
Theory
Line 166 (positional updating paragraph): "The intuition is straightforward: procedures and outcomes carry different weight depending on whether you are in or out of power." → "Straightforward" is slightly defensive (as if anticipating the complaint that the theory is too simple). Consider: "The core logic turns on asymmetric salience: procedures and outcomes carry different weight depending on whether one is in or out of power."
Line 172: "it is that procedural protections become genuinely more relevant to people who lack access to executive power." → "Genuinely" is unnecessary hedging-against-the-hedging. Delete.
Results
Line 308: "No single item is carrying the result." → Colloquial. → "No single item drives the result."
Line 410: "What separates the two cases is institutional: South Korea resolved its crisis through constitutional channels, not tanks." → The "not tanks" is punchy but appears twice in the manuscript (also in the introduction, line 128: "Thailand's crisis was resolved by tanks"). The repetition is effective rhetorically but JEAS reviewers may find it heavy-handed on second reading. Consider varying the phrasing here: "South Korea resolved its crisis through constitutional channels—impeachment, judicial review, a free election—rather than military intervention."
Line 412: "Among the remaining countries (Table 2), Malaysia shows a large gap that narrows across waves, potentially reflecting the political opening that culminated in the 2018 alternation." → This paragraph compresses six countries into four sentences. The compression is necessary for word count but Myanmar and Taiwan each get only one sentence. Consider whether Taiwan's reversal needs more explanation or whether flagging it as a puzzle and pointing to an appendix would be more honest.
Mechanism Tests
Lines 463–469: The protective-participatory distinction is the manuscript's most original theoretical contribution beyond the basic positional updating framework. But it's introduced in the results section rather than the theory section. Consider whether a brief anticipation in the theory section (perhaps 2–3 sentences after line 174) would strengthen the paper's theoretical architecture, allowing you to derive the fairness interaction predictions from theory rather than introducing them post hoc in the results.
Line 497: "That is harder to square with blanket grievance and easier to square with a discriminating assessment of which institutions still function as credible constraints." → "Blanket grievance" is slightly informal. → "generalized grievance."
Discussion
Line 588: "Three pieces of evidence tilt toward the positional interpretation: (1)... (2)... (3)..." → This three-part summary appears identically in both the cumulative interpretation section (line 560) AND the discussion opening (line 588). The repetition feels like the paper is stalling. In the discussion, consider condensing to: "The cumulative evidence—fairness amplification, domain specificity, and compositional stability—tilts toward the positional interpretation." Then move directly to the implications.
Line 596 (measurement paragraph): This is one of the paper's strongest discussion paragraphs. The Rich (2025) citation does excellent work. No changes needed.
Line 600 (order-versus-contestation): The Slater (2010) connection is interesting but feels underdeveloped. Either expand it (if word count allows) or cut the paragraph. As written, it opens an inquiry without advancing it.
Conclusion
Line 604–610: The conclusion is tight and well-calibrated. The final sentence ("the positional account has more going for it than cultural determinism does") is appropriately confident without overclaiming. No changes needed.
***10. RECURRING STYLISTIC PATTERNS TO ADDRESS
Doubled formulations. The manuscript occasionally says the same thing twice in slightly different words:
Line 410: "The impeachment showed that accountability mechanisms actually worked, and the 2017 election produced genuine turnover. The impeachment demonstrated that accountability mechanisms functioned, and the 2017 election delivered genuine alternation." — This is literally the same sentence said twice. Delete one.
Em-dash overuse. The manuscript uses em-dashes approximately 30 times. Many are effective (they create useful parenthetical asides), but when every other paragraph has one, the device loses its punch. Consider converting ~10 of them to parentheses or subordinate clauses.
"Rather than" constructions. The phrase "rather than" appears ~12 times. It's a useful comparative frame but becomes a verbal tic at this frequency. Alternatives: "instead of," "as opposed to," "in place of," or restructuring the sentence entirely.
The word "precisely." Appears 5 times. It's a strong word when used once; at five occurrences it reads as a mannerism. Keep the two most important uses and find alternatives for the others.
***11. PRIORITY EDITS (ranked by impact)
Fix the doubled sentence at line 410. This is a copy-paste error and will be noticed by any reviewer.
Integrate the three missing citations (Cohen et al. 2022, Wu & Chang 2022, Bryan 2023). Their absence is the most significant gap in the literature engagement.
Soften "demonstrates" to "presents evidence" at line 130. This is the single word most likely to draw a reviewer's red pen given the observational design.
Tighten the cumulative interpretation section (lines 558–568) to remove colloquialisms and second-person address.
Consider moving the protective-participatory distinction (or at least a brief anticipation of it) into the theory section to strengthen the theoretical architecture.
Vary the methods section's sentence rhythm to avoid monotonous mid-length phrasing.
Reduce em-dash and "rather than" frequency across the manuscript for stylistic variety.
