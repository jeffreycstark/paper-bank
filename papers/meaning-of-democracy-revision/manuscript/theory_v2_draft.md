# Positional Updating and Democratic Conceptions

The argument proceeds in three steps. First, I establish that citizens hold meaningfully different conceptions of democracy, varying in the weight they assign to procedural rules versus substantive outcomes. Second, I draw on the winner-loser gap literature to argue that electoral status creates systematically different orientations toward these dimensions. Third, I specify the mechanism---positional updating---and derive predictions that distinguish it from competing accounts.

## The procedural-substantive distinction

A foundational line of comparative research distinguishes procedural from substantive conceptions of democracy. Procedural definitions emphasize the rules and institutions through which political decisions are made: competitive elections, civil liberties, rule of law, and mechanisms of accountability [@Dahl1971-lu; @Schumpeter2010-jp; @Schedler1998-dl]. Substantive definitions focus on outcomes: economic equality, social welfare, and responsiveness to citizen demands [@Diamond1999-wd; @Linz1996-qs]. Empirical research confirms that ordinary citizens hold both types of conceptions, with the balance varying across contexts. Citizens in newer democracies tend to emphasize substantive outcomes, while those in established democracies more frequently cite procedural elements [@Russell-J-Dalton-Doh-C-Shin-and-Willy-Jou2007-gm; @Bratton2001-ug]. In Asia specifically, publics hold complex, multidimensional understandings that blend procedural and substantive elements, with substantial variation both within and between countries [@Chu2008-fk; @Chu2010-nb; @Cho2014-tj; @Shin2018-mq].

This variation matters because how citizens define democracy shapes how they evaluate it. If democracy means free elections, competitive voting may suffice for legitimacy; if it means economic equality, procedural compliance without material progress breeds disillusionment. Yet existing scholarship has largely treated conceptions as stable attributes of individuals or societies---cultural inheritances shaped by historical experience, regime type, or modernization trajectories [@Shin2011-kc; @Inglehart1997-gw; @Canache2012-fb; @Ferrin2016-se]. Relatively little work has asked what drives *within-country, within-period* variation in how individual citizens conceptualize democracy.

## Electoral status as a source of conceptual divergence

The winner-loser gap literature provides a candidate answer. A large body of research demonstrates that citizens whose preferred party won the most recent election differ systematically from those whose party lost: winners express greater institutional trust, higher satisfaction with democracy, and greater willingness to accept political outcomes [@Anderson2005-uk; @Anderson2002-cv; @Nadeau1993-vo]. The magnitude of these gaps varies with institutional context---losers' discontent is more pronounced in majoritarian systems [@Anderson1997-dh; @Singh2012-hj]---and procedural fairness perceptions mediate the relationship [@Esaiasson2011-po; @Esaiasson2020-av]. Recent extensions have confirmed these dynamics in non-Western settings and across regime types [@Blais2025-qq; @Mauk2020-bu].

This literature, however, has focused on *evaluations*---how much citizens support, trust, or feel satisfied with democracy---while treating the underlying object of evaluation as shared. Winners and losers are assumed to mean the same thing when they express views about "democracy"; they simply differ in how positively they assess it. If electoral status shapes not only evaluations but *conceptions*---if winners and losers are in fact evaluating different things---then the winner-loser gap may be deeper than the existing literature has recognized, and the two literatures' isolation from one another represents a missed theoretical opportunity.

## Positional updating: mechanism and predictions

I propose that electoral status shapes democratic conceptions through a process of positional updating. The core logic rests on the differential salience of procedures and outcomes for those in and out of power. When one's preferred party controls government, substantive outcomes command attention: what policies will be enacted, what material benefits will flow. For those excluded from power, procedures become paramount: will there be a fair chance to compete again? Will civil liberties protect against retribution? Will accountability mechanisms constrain those who govern?

This selective attention is driven by motivated cognition [@Kunda1990-uw; @Taber2006-kx]. Citizens do not arrive at their understanding of democracy through disinterested reflection; rather, they attend to and weight those dimensions of democracy that are instrumentally relevant to their political position. Losers orient toward procedural features because procedures are the tools of the excluded---the mechanisms through which power can be contested, checked, and ultimately recaptured. Winners orient toward substantive outcomes because they occupy the position from which outcomes are delivered. In this sense, the mechanism parallels the political conditioning of economic perceptions documented in other domains: just as partisan position shapes whether citizens view the economy favorably [@Evans2006-np; @Fiorina1978-wf], electoral status shapes which features of democracy citizens attend to and prioritize. Emphasizing procedural democracy also serves losers' discursive interests: a government can be criticized for violating democratic procedures in ways that a government cannot easily be criticized for failing to realize one's preferred substantive vision.

The positional account generates three testable predictions, each of which distinguishes it from the most plausible alternative---that democratic conceptions are stable cultural orientations or fixed psychological dispositions.

First, if conceptions reflect positional interests, losers should prioritize procedural over substantive elements of democracy relative to winners. This prediction is shared with the cultural account, which might attribute any observed differences to the broader political orientations of parties in opposition.

*H1:* Electoral losers will be more likely than winners to prioritize procedural over substantive conceptions of democracy.

Second, the positional logic implies that the magnitude of the gap should vary with the stakes of losing. Where power alternates regularly and institutional checks limit what winners can do, the positional distinction carries less weight---both sides retain access to democratic procedures regardless. Where losing is consequential and potentially permanent, the need for procedural protections becomes acute. Loss aversion [@Kahneman1979-af] reinforces this dynamic: the threat of losing established rights weighs more heavily than the prospect of gaining new benefits, amplifying losers' orientation toward procedural safeguards.

*H2:* The loser effect will be larger in political contexts where losing is more consequential---where democratic institutions are weaker or power alternation less frequent.

Third, and most critically for distinguishing positional updating from cultural accounts: if conceptions are cultural inheritances or stable dispositions, they should not shift appreciably within countries over periods shorter than a generation. The positional account, by contrast, predicts that conceptions will respond dynamically to changes in the political stakes of losing---growing when institutions weaken and shrinking when institutional protections are restored through alternation or constitutional resolution of crises.

*H3:* Within countries, the loser effect will respond to changes in political context, growing when democratic institutions weaken and shrinking when power alternates.

H3 is the hypothesis that most sharply distinguishes the positional account from its alternatives, and the one whose confirmation would represent the strongest evidence for the theoretical framework advanced here. The within-country trajectories examined below provide the most direct test.
