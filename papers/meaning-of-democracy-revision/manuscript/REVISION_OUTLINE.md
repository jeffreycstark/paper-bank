# Revision Outline: What Does Democracy Mean to Electoral Losers?

## Revision rationale
Asian Survey desk reject (form letter citing: clearly defined research question, fully developed theory, contribution to literature). Diagnosis: (1) theory underdeveloped relative to empirics, (2) contribution framing reads as gap-spotting, (3) paper peaks late — best material buried after modest pooled results, (4) Free Elections anomaly unaddressed, (5) paper too long for what it delivers. See conversation with Claude for full diagnosis.

## Target journals (in order)
1. **Journal of East Asian Studies** — perfect topical fit, values empirical ABS work
2. **Democratization** — publishes winner-loser gap and erosion papers regularly
3. **Asian Journal of Political Science** — fallback, faster turnaround

## Word target
~8,500–9,500 words main text (down from ~12,000+). Appendix stays mostly intact.

## NEW STRUCTURE

### Abstract (~200 words)
Rewrite to lead with the dynamic finding and its implications, not the pooled result.
- Open: Democratic erosion may reshape not just citizens' satisfaction with democracy but their understanding of what democracy means.
- Core finding: Thailand's gap went from 0 to 24pp tracking institutional erosion; South Korea's stayed flat when crisis was resolved constitutionally.
- Broader pattern: Pooled across 11 countries, losers systematically favor procedural conceptions.
- Implication: Where erosion is severe, procedural commitments concentrate among the powerless.

### 1. Introduction (~1,200 words)

**Para 1: Open with Thailand.** Between 2010 and 2020, Thailand experienced a coup, prolonged military governance, and the progressive erosion of democratic institutions. During the same period, the gap between how electoral winners and losers conceptualize democracy widened from near zero to over 24 percentage points. This is not a story about satisfaction or trust — it is about what citizens think democracy *fundamentally means*.

**Para 2: The South Korea contrast.** South Korea experienced its own political crisis — impeachment, removal of a president — but resolved it constitutionally. The conceptual gap between winners and losers remained negligible throughout. Where institutions hold, winners and losers converge on democratic meaning; where they erode, meaning itself becomes contested along winner-loser lines.

**Para 3: The broader puzzle.** These trajectories raise a question the existing literature has not addressed. A large body of work documents how electoral status shapes *evaluations* of democracy — satisfaction, trust, legitimacy. A separate literature examines how citizens *conceive* of democracy — procedurally, substantively, or in terms of governance quality. But these literatures have developed in isolation, leaving unexamined whether winners and losers understand democracy differently, and whether those understandings shift with political conditions.

**Para 4: What this paper does.** Using four waves of ABS data across 11 countries (N ≈ 23,464), this article shows that electoral losers systematically prioritize procedural democracy while winners emphasize substantive outcomes — and that this gap responds dynamically to democratic erosion. The finding carries a troubling implication: where erosion is most severe, the citizens who most value free elections and civil liberties are precisely those whom the political system has rendered least able to demand them.

**Para 5: Contributions (brief).** Two contributions: (1) bridges conceptions and winner-loser literatures by showing electoral status shapes democratic *meaning*, not just evaluation; (2) demonstrates that conceptions are not stable cultural orientations but respond to the political stakes of losing — a finding with implications for understanding democratic resilience during the current global erosion.

### 2. Theory: Positional Updating and Democratic Conceptions (~1,500 words)

**Key change from v1:** Merge the two-section lit review into a single, tighter theory section. Weave the literature in as you develop the argument rather than reviewing it in separate blocks.

**2a. The procedural-substantive distinction (~400 words).** Brief setup of how citizens conceptualize democracy (procedural vs. substantive), citing the key works. The point is not a comprehensive review but enough to establish the dependent variable. Note that existing work treats conceptions as relatively stable — cultural inheritances or psychological dispositions.

**2b. The winner-loser gap and its limits (~400 words).** Electoral status shapes satisfaction, trust, legitimacy. But this literature assumes a *shared conception* of what democracy means. If winners and losers define democracy differently, they may be evaluating different things — a disconnect with implications for both survey measurement and democratic theory.

**2c. Positional updating: the mechanism (~500 words).** Commit clearly to one theoretical account: **positional updating**. When excluded from power, citizens attend selectively to dimensions of democracy that are instrumentally relevant to regaining it — procedures that constrain winners and protect losers' ability to compete. This is driven by the differential salience of procedures vs. outcomes depending on one's position: winners focus on what government delivers, losers on the rules governing competition. Loss aversion amplifies this: the threat of losing protections weighs more than the prospect of gaining benefits. 

**Crucially, distinguish from alternatives:** If conceptions are cultural inheritances, they should be stable over time within countries. If they are fixed psychological dispositions, they should not respond to political conditions. The positional account uniquely predicts *dynamic responsiveness* — conceptions should shift as the stakes of losing change.

**2d. Hypotheses (~200 words).** Same three hypotheses, but now they flow directly from a cleaner theoretical argument:
- H1: Losers prioritize procedural > substantive conceptions
- H2: Gap larger where losing is more consequential (weaker institutions, less alternation)  
- H3: Gap responds dynamically to within-country changes in political conditions

### 3. Data and Methods (~1,500 words)
Largely unchanged from v1. Modest tightening:
- Cut ~200 words of boilerplate
- Keep the multinomial logit specification, AME reporting, wild bootstrap
- Keep the procedural-substantive gap metric explanation
- Move some variable construction details to appendix if needed for length

### 4. Results (~2,500 words)

**Key structural change: Lead with the dynamic trajectories (H2/H3), supported by the pooled baseline (H1).**

**4a. The baseline loser effect (~800 words).** Pooled AME results across 20 items. Report the pattern: 9/10 procedural items positive, all 6 substantive items negative. Acknowledge effects are individually modest (2-4 pp) but collectively consistent. **Address the Free Elections anomaly directly here** — suggest losers who've experienced procedural failures may distrust the electoral mechanism specifically while valuing the broader liberal ecosystem (media, expression, courts, protest) that enables contestation outside elections. This is a finding, not an embarrassment.

Governance items: winners prefer law-and-order conceptions, losers prefer contestation-and-rights conceptions. Note the tension.

Table 1: Pooled AMEs (same as v1).

**4b. Country trajectories: erosion and resilience (~1,200 words).** This is the paper's centerpiece.

- **Thailand** (~400 words): Walk through the trajectory in detail. W3 → W4 → W6 tracking the 2014 coup and prolonged military governance. The 24pp gap by W6 cannot be explained by cultural change or compositional shift.
- **South Korea** (~250 words): The mirror image. Park impeachment, constitutional resolution, alternation. Gap stayed ≤5pp throughout. Institutional resolution → convergence.
- **Cambodia** (~150 words): Persistently large gap (~13pp), didn't grow after CNRP dissolution — stakes already maximized.
- **Other countries** (~200 words): Brief discussion of remaining trajectories. Malaysia's narrowing gap and 2018 alternation. Taiwan's reversal. Japan's stable baseline.

Figure 1: Trajectory plot (same as v1, this is already good).
Table 2: Country-wave gaps with CIs.

**4c. Mechanism test: perceived electoral fairness (~500 words).** PROMOTED FROM APPENDIX I. If positional updating drives the effect, it should intensify among losers who perceive elections as unfair (higher perceived procedural threat). Results: court protection +6.0pp, media freedom +3.5pp interaction. This distinguishes the positional account from stable commitments — committed proceduralists would prioritize procedures regardless of fairness perceptions.

### 5. Robustness (~600 words)
Compressed from v1. Brief paragraphs covering:
- WLS aggregated estimation replicates main findings
- Wave 2 directional consistency across different instrument
- Open-ended validation (r = 0.28 convergent validity)
- COVID-19 controls: essentially unchanged estimates; Thailand's gap persists through pandemic
- Non-voter analysis: non-voters resemble winners, exclusion doesn't inflate effect
- Three-way decomposition: null results, note as future research direction (1–2 sentences, full results in appendix)

### 6. Discussion (~1,000 words)
- Positional updating vs. cultural/dispositional alternatives: Thailand trajectory falsifies stable-culture account
- Winners and losers may talk past each other when expressing views about "democracy"
- Order vs. contestation tension (governance items finding)
- Democratic erosion concentrates procedural commitments among the powerless — implications for the resilience literature (Claassen 2020, Svolik 2019, Graham & Svolik 2020)
- Limitations: repeated cross-sections, non-voters, Wave 6 COVID compression, 11 countries

### 7. Conclusion (~400 words)
- Core finding restated
- Troubling implication: procedural commitments and political power become inversely related under erosion
- Future directions: behavioral consequences (protest, civil disobedience); extension beyond Asia
- Brief, no new information
