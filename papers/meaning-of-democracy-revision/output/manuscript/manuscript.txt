What Does Democracy Mean to Electoral Losers? Evidence from Asia
Jeffrey Stark
2026-02-10

Introduction

In a well-functioning democracy, losing an election is supposed to be
tolerable. The defeated party’s supporters accept the outcome and
political life continues, sustained by the expectation that today’s
losers may become tomorrow’s winners. This pattern of “losers’ consent”
is widely regarded as essential to democratic stability (Anderson et al.
2005; Nadeau and Blais 1993). Yet the extensive literature documenting
how electoral status shapes political attitudes has focused almost
exclusively on evaluations of democracy—satisfaction, trust, perceived
legitimacy (Anderson and LoTempio 2002; Singh et al. 2012)—while leaving
largely unexamined a more fundamental question: do winners and losers
share a common understanding of what democracy means?

This article argues that they do not. Drawing on four waves of Asian
Barometer Survey data spanning seventeen years and encompassing more
than 23,464 voters across 11 countries, I show that electoral losers
systematically prioritize procedural elements of democracy—competitive
elections, civil liberties, government accountability—over substantive
outcomes such as economic equality or welfare provision. This “loser
effect” operates across diverse political contexts, from Japan’s
consolidated democracy to Cambodia’s competitive authoritarian regime.

The more striking finding concerns dynamics. In Thailand, as democratic
institutions eroded through successive coups, the gap between how
winners and losers conceptualize democracy widened from near zero to
over 24 percentage points—a shift that cannot be explained by
slow-moving cultural change. In South Korea, where a comparable
political crisis was resolved through constitutional procedures and
genuine alternation followed, the gap remained negligible. These
contrasting trajectories suggest that conceptions of democracy respond
to the political stakes of losing: where losing becomes consequential
and potentially permanent, losers increasingly define democracy in terms
of the procedural protections they lack. The resulting dynamic is
troubling. Where democratic erosion is most severe, support for
procedural democracy becomes concentrated among those whom the political
system has rendered least capable of defending it—the citizens who most
need free elections and civil liberties are precisely those who have
lost the power to demand them.

The analysis makes two contributions. First, it bridges the literatures
on democratic conceptions and the winner-loser gap by showing that
electoral status shapes not merely how citizens evaluate democracy but
how they understand it. Second, it employs multinomial logit models that
preserve the full structure of respondents’ choices across twenty survey
items, avoiding the binary procedural-substantive classifications that
prior work has relied upon. This approach allows patterns to emerge from
the data rather than from the analyst’s coding decisions—a
methodological advantage that proves substantively consequential, as the
disaggregated results reveal heterogeneity within the procedural
category that binary coding would obscure.

Literature and Theory

Conceptions of Democracy

The foundational distinction in the study of democratic conceptions
contrasts procedural and substantive understandings. Procedural
definitions emphasize the rules and institutions through which political
decisions are made: competitive elections, civil liberties, rule of law,
and mechanisms of accountability (Schumpeter 2010; Dahl 1971; Schmitter
and Karl 1991; Schedler 1998). Substantive definitions focus on
outcomes: economic equality, social welfare, responsiveness to citizen
demands (Diamond 1999; Linz and Stepan 1996). Empirical research
confirms that ordinary citizens hold both types of conceptions, with the
balance varying across contexts. Citizens in newer democracies often
emphasize substantive outcomes, particularly economic development, while
those in established democracies more frequently cite procedural
elements (Russell J. Dalton, Doh C. Shin, and Willy Jou 2007; Bratton
and Mattes 2001).

Whether citizens conceive of democracy in procedural or substantive
terms proves to be a multidimensional problem, with structural
complexity that resists simple classification (Canache 2012; Coppedge et
al. 2011). Comparative work on Europe confirms that citizens hold varied
and often internally complex understandings of democracy (Ferrin and
Kriesi 2016; Hernández 2016), raising the question of whether similar
patterns obtain in Asia, where democratic experiences differ markedly.
In Asia, publics hold complex, multidimensional understandings that
blend procedural and substantive elements, with substantial variation
both within and between countries (Chu et al. 2008; Chu and Huang 2010;
Cho 2014).

This variation matters because how citizens define democracy shapes how
they evaluate it. If democracy means free elections, then competitive
voting may suffice for legitimacy. If it means economic equality, then
procedural compliance without material progress breeds disillusionment.
Yet relatively little scholarship has examined what drives
individual-level variation in democratic conceptions. Existing work
emphasizes cross-national differences rooted in historical experience or
cultural traditions (Shin 2011; Shin and Kim 2018; Inglehart 1997) but
largely treats conceptions as stable attributes of individuals or
societies.

The Winner-Loser Gap

A separate body of research documents systematic differences in
political attitudes between electoral winners and losers. Pioneered by
Anderson et al. (2005; see also Nadeau and Blais 1993; Anderson and
LoTempio 2002), this literature demonstrates that citizens whose
preferred party won the most recent election express greater trust in
political institutions, higher satisfaction with democracy, and greater
willingness to comply with political decisions. The magnitude of these
gaps varies with institutional context: losers’ discontent is more
pronounced in majoritarian systems, where losing means complete
exclusion from power, than in proportional systems (Anderson and
Guillory 1997; Singh et al. 2012). Procedural fairness perceptions
mediate the relationship—losers who perceive the process as fair show
smaller attitudinal deficits (Esaiasson 2011; Esaiasson and Öhberg
2020). Recent work has extended these insights to non-Western
democracies and deliberative settings (Blais et al. 2025), while Mauk
(2020) demonstrates that citizen support operates differently across
regime types—a distinction particularly relevant to the diverse
political systems examined here.

Despite the richness of both literatures, they have developed largely in
isolation. The conceptions literature examines what citizens think
democracy means but treats these beliefs as relatively stable. The
winner-loser literature documents how electoral status shapes attitudes
but focuses on evaluations rather than underlying conceptions. This
article bridges these literatures by asking whether electoral status
shapes not just how citizens evaluate democracy but how they understand
it.

Positional Logic and Hypotheses

The theoretical logic connecting electoral status to democratic
conceptions rests on the differing salience of procedures and outcomes
for those in and out of power. When one’s preferred party controls
government, substantive outcomes command attention: what policies will
be enacted, what benefits will flow. For those excluded from power,
procedures become paramount: will there be a fair chance to compete
again? Will civil liberties protect against retribution? Will
accountability mechanisms constrain those who govern? Losers come to
value precisely what they lack.

This mechanism is partly cognitive—motivated reasoning leads citizens to
selectively weight considerations that favor their political position
(Kunda 1990; Taber and Lodge 2006)—and partly normative. Emphasizing
procedural democracy serves the political interests of losers by
establishing grounds for critique and demanding adherence to rules that
constrain winners. A substantive conception provides less rhetorical
leverage: one cannot easily criticize a government for failing to be
democratic simply because one dislikes its policies.

If conceptions of democracy reflect positional interests, then the
magnitude of the winner-loser gap should vary with the stakes of losing.
Where power alternates regularly and institutional checks limit what
winners can do, the distinction matters less. Where losing is
consequential and potentially permanent, the need for procedural
protections becomes acute. Loss aversion (Kahneman and Tversky 1979)
reinforces this dynamic: the threat of losing established rights and
protections weighs more heavily than the prospect of gaining new
benefits, amplifying losers’ orientation toward the procedural
safeguards that might prevent further erosion. The political
conditioning of perceptions documented in other domains (Evans and
Andersen 2006; Fiorina 1978) suggests a similar process here: just as
partisan position shapes economic evaluations, electoral status may
shape which features of democracy citizens attend to and prioritize.
Further, if the positional theory is correct, conceptions should respond
dynamically to changes in political conditions within countries over
time—a prediction that distinguishes this account from alternatives
emphasizing stable cultural values or psychological dispositions.

These considerations generate three hypotheses:

H1: Electoral losers will be more likely than winners to prioritize
procedural over substantive conceptions of democracy.

H2: The loser effect will be larger in political contexts where losing
is more consequential—where democratic institutions are weaker or power
alternation less frequent.

H3: Within countries, the loser effect will respond to changes in
political context, growing when democratic institutions weaken and
shrinking when power alternates.

Data and Methods

Data

The analysis draws on the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS), a regional
comparative project tracking democratic values across Asia since 2001
(Hu et al. 2008, 2012, 2016; Chu et al. 2022).[1] The ABS covers
countries spanning the full range of regime types (Chu et al. 2016) and
employs forced-choice items requiring respondents to prioritize among
competing democratic values, providing cleaner identification of
relative orientations than agree-disagree batteries.

Four waves are analyzed: Wave 2 (2005–2008), Wave 3 (2010–2012), Wave 4
(2014–2016), and Wave 6 (2019–2022). Wave 5 is excluded because it did
not include the relevant items. China and Vietnam are excluded because
their single-party systems do not produce meaningful electoral winners
and losers. The analysis is restricted to respondents who reported
voting in the most recent national election, as winner-loser status
cannot be meaningfully assigned to non-voters. This restriction is not
merely a methodological necessity but a theoretically motivated choice:
voters are the citizens whose democratic conceptions most directly
translate into political demands through electoral participation, party
mobilization, and protest. A study of how electoral outcomes reshape
democratic understanding is, by definition, a study of the electorally
engaged. After these restrictions, the sample comprises 23,464
observations across 11 countries.

Measurement

In Waves 3, 4, and 6, the ABS presented respondents with four item sets,
each containing four statements describing different aspects of
democracy. Respondents indicated which statement they considered most
important. Each set included procedural items (e.g., “People can choose
their leaders in free and fair elections,” “Government protects people’s
freedom of speech”), substantive items (e.g., “Government reduces the
gap between the rich and the poor,” “Government provides everyone with
the basic necessities of life”), and governance items (e.g., “Government
does not waste public money,” “People’s safety from crime is
guaranteed”). Wave 2 employed a single forced-choice item with different
response options and is analyzed separately.

The key independent variable is electoral status, derived from the ABS
vote-choice item (q34a in Waves 4 and 6, q33a in Wave 3, q39a in Wave
2). For each country-wave, the ABS research team codes each respondent’s
self-reported vote choice against the outcome of the most recent
national election prior to fieldwork, classifying respondents as winners
(voted for the governing party, president, or coalition partner) or
losers (voted for any non-governing party). The analysis adopts this
binary coding throughout. Respondents who did not vote, refused to
answer, or reported an invalid vote choice are excluded, restricting the
sample to citizens whose electoral participation permits meaningful
assignment of winner-loser status. One country-wave is dropped entirely:
Thailand Wave 4, where the February 2014 election was annulled by the
Constitutional Court and the military seized power before ABS fieldwork
began, leaving no valid prior election to reference. Appendix Section B
documents the reference election, winning party, and runner-up for each
country-wave; reports an independent verification of the ABS coding
against official election commission data for Taiwan, South Korea, and
Thailand; and discusses additional edge cases including Thailand’s
government-formation coding and Cambodia’s opposition dissolution.
Control variables include age, gender, education level, and urban-rural
residence.

Analytical Strategy

Rather than collapsing responses into a binary procedural–substantive
indicator, the analysis models each item set as a separate multinomial
logistic regression, preserving all four response categories within each
set. For Waves 3, 4, and 6, which share a common instrument of four item
sets (Sets 1–4), data are pooled across waves and modeled jointly. Each
set takes the form:

$$
\Pr(Y_{ij} = k) = \frac{\exp(\beta_{0k} + \beta_{1k}\text{Loser}_i + \mathbf{X}_i\boldsymbol{\gamma}_k + \alpha_{ck} + \delta_{tk})}{\sum_{m=1}^{4}\exp(\beta_{0m} + \beta_{1m}\text{Loser}_i + \mathbf{X}_i\boldsymbol{\gamma}_m + \alpha_{cm} + \delta_{tm})}
$$

where Y_(ij) denotes the item selected by respondent i in set j, k
indexes the four response categories within each set, X_(i) is a vector
of demographic controls (age, gender, education, and urban–rural
residence), and α_(ck) and δ_(tk) represent category-specific country
and wave fixed effects. The reference category is set internally by the
estimation routine; because results are reported as average marginal
effects (AMEs), the choice of baseline category does not affect
interpretation. AMEs express the effect of loser status as
percentage-point changes in the predicted probability of selecting each
item, offering a direct and intuitive quantity of interest across all
twenty items.

Wave 2, which employed a single forced-choice item with a distinct set
of response options, is modeled separately using the same multinomial
logit specification (without wave fixed effects, as it draws from a
single survey round). Including Wave 2 provides an independent check on
the robustness of the loser effect across different measurement
instruments.

Standard errors are computed via wild cluster bootstrap at the country
level, following Cameron et al. (2008). With only eleven country
clusters in the pooled sample, conventional cluster-robust variance
estimators are known to produce downward-biased standard errors and
over-reject the null hypothesis. The wild bootstrap imposes the null
hypothesis on the bootstrap data-generating process, providing more
reliable inference with few clusters. This approach yields conservative
tests throughout the analysis.

To examine country-level variation and within-country trajectories (H2
and H3), the multinomial logit models are re-estimated separately for
each country-wave combination. For each estimate, I compute the
procedural–substantive gap: the difference between the mean AME of loser
status across procedural items and the mean AME across substantive items
within a given country-wave. A positive gap indicates that losers
disproportionately favor procedural conceptions relative to substantive
ones. Confidence intervals for these gaps are obtained via the same wild
bootstrap procedure. Tracking these gaps across waves within countries
allows direct assessment of whether conceptions of democracy respond to
changing political conditions—the central prediction distinguishing the
positional account from cultural or dispositional alternatives.

Results

The Overall Loser Effect

Table 1 reports the average marginal effect of loser status on the
probability of selecting each of the twenty items across the pooled
sample. The pattern is consistent with H1: 9 of 10 procedural items show
positive effects (losers more likely to select), while all 6 substantive
items show negative effects (winners more likely to select). Procedural
effects range from 0.3 to 3.8 percentage points, with Media freedom
showing the largest effect (+3.8 pp, p < 0.001). Substantive effects
range from -2.1 to -0.8 pp, with Basic necessities as the largest (-2.1
pp, p = 0.023).

The individual effects are modest—typically two to four percentage
points—but the consistency of the pattern across twenty items from five
separate batteries is notable. This is not a result driven by one or two
items. Winners and losers differ systematically in how they
conceptualize democracy, with losers oriented toward the rules governing
political competition and winners oriented toward the material benefits
government provides.

The governance items—qualities such as law and order, clean politics,
and efficient public services that describe neither political freedoms
nor material redistribution—reveal an additional pattern. Winners are
consistently more likely to select governance items, with Law and order
showing the largest effect (-5.0 pp, p < 0.001). This result suggests
that winners are drawn to conceptions of democracy emphasizing order and
state capacity, while losers favor conceptions emphasizing political
competition and civil liberties—a tension explored further in the
discussion.

Country-Level Variation and Trajectories

Figure 1 plots the procedural–substantive gap—the difference between the
mean loser AME on procedural items and on substantive items—for each
country across waves. A positive value indicates that losers
disproportionately favor procedural conceptions relative to substantive
ones. Table 1 reports the full set of country-wave estimates; four
trajectories merit particular discussion.

Thailand provides the most dramatic support for H3. In Wave 3
(2010–2012), during the Democrat Party government of Abhisit Vejjajiva,
the procedural–substantive gap was negligible (-0.8 pp, not
significant). By Wave 4 (2014–2016), conducted around the time of the
May 2014 coup that removed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, the gap
had widened to 11 pp (p < 0.05). By Wave 6 (2019–2022), after six years
of military or military-backed governance, the gap reached 23.8 pp
(p < 0.001, 95% CI: [17.3, 30.2]). This trajectory—from zero to over
twenty percentage points in a decade—tracks Thailand’s democratic
erosion with remarkable precision (Kuhonta and Sinpeng 2014; Kongkirati
and Morgenbesser 2020). As coups and judicial interventions repeatedly
overturned electoral outcomes, supporters of the excluded
Thaksin-aligned faction increasingly defined democracy in procedural
terms, while supporters of the military-backed order emphasized
substantive outcomes.

South Korea presents the mirror image. Despite experiencing its own
political upheaval during this period—including the impeachment and
removal of President Park Geun-hye in 2016–2017 and the subsequent
election of the progressive Moon Jae-in—the procedural–substantive gap
remained modest throughout, fluctuating between 4.8 pp in Wave 3 and 1
pp in Wave 4, never exceeding five percentage points. The critical
difference from Thailand is institutional: South Korea’s crisis was
resolved through constitutional procedures rather than military
intervention. The impeachment demonstrated that accountability
mechanisms functioned, and the 2017 election delivered genuine
alternation. Under these conditions, the positional logic predicts
convergence, and convergence is what the data show. Where losing remains
temporary and institutional protections hold, winners and losers have
little reason to define democracy differently.

Japan presents the expected baseline for a consolidated democracy: the
loser effect remains modest and stable across waves. Losing an election
in Japan carries limited consequences—the opposition retains
parliamentary voice, civil liberties are secure, and electoral
alternation remains credible.

Cambodia shows a persistently large gap (approximately 13 pp across all
three waves) that, notably, did not grow following the dissolution of
the main opposition party (CNRP) in 2017. This stability likely reflects
the fact that in a competitive authoritarian context, the stakes of
losing were already effectively maximized well before the formal
dissolution—losers’ procedural orientation had little room to intensify.
A compositional shift may also contribute, as the removal of the
opposition party from the political arena likely altered which
respondents identified as losers.

The remaining countries in Table 1 reveal additional heterogeneity.
Malaysia shows a large gap that narrows across waves, potentially
reflecting the political opening that culminated in the historic 2018
alternation of power. Myanmar’s single observation captures a strikingly
large gap consistent with the high stakes of its fragile democratic
transition. Taiwan’s trajectory is distinctive, shifting from a positive
gap to a negative one by Wave 6—a reversal that may reflect the unusual
dynamics of cross-strait identity politics, where “losing” carries
different connotations than in other democracies. The full set of
item-level estimates for all country-wave combinations appears in the
online appendix (Tables D1–D2).

Wave 2 Baseline

The Wave 2 results, based on a different instrument, provide suggestive
corroboration. Both procedural items show positive AMEs (Elections: +2.8
pp; Criticize power: +0.6 pp) and both substantive items show negative
AMEs (Income equality: -1.3 pp; Basic necessities: -2.1 pp), though only
2 of four reach conventional significance. The directional consistency
across a different measurement instrument and earlier time period
increases confidence that the loser effect is not an artifact of the
Wave 3–6 battery design. As a further check on construct validity,
open-ended responses from Wave 2—in which respondents described in their
own words what democracy meant to them—confirm that those selecting
procedural items in the closed-ended measure were significantly more
likely to offer procedural definitions spontaneously (p < .001),
suggesting that the forced-choice items capture genuine differences in
how citizens conceptualize democracy rather than artifacts of item
framing.[2]

Robustness

The main estimates rely on wild cluster bootstrap inference at the
country level, but with eleven clusters the finite-sample properties of
any cluster-based procedure remain a concern (Cameron et al. 2008). As a
more conservative check, I aggregate the data to the country-wave level
and estimate the loser effect using weighted least squares (WLS), where
the dependent variable is the difference in the proportion of winners
and losers selecting each item within a country-wave cell, and
observations are weighted by sample size. This approach sidesteps the
clustering problem entirely: each country-wave contributes a single
observation, yielding twenty-six units for the Waves 3–6 items and eight
for Wave 2. The cost is the loss of individual-level variation and the
inability to include demographic controls, but as a diagnostic for
whether the main patterns survive a radically different estimation
strategy, it is informative.

The WLS results closely replicate the main findings. Nine of ten
procedural items show positive loser effects (six significant at p <
0.05), all six substantive items show negative effects (five
significant), and all four governance items show negative effects (one
significant). The mean effect sizes—+2.2 percentage points for
procedural items, -2.4 for substantive, -1.9 for governance—are
comparable to the individual-level estimates, suggesting that the main
results are not artifacts of the clustering structure or of the specific
variance estimator employed.

A final robustness check addresses the weakened loser effect observed in
Wave 6 across most countries. Because Wave 6 fieldwork coincided with
the COVID-19 pandemic, state capacity became salient for all citizens
regardless of electoral status, potentially compressing the
procedural-substantive gap. Two Wave 6 items permit a direct test:
respondents’ evaluations of their government’s handling of the pandemic
and their trust in government-provided COVID-19 information. If the
pandemic’s homogenizing effect operates through heightened attention to
state performance, controlling for these COVID attitudes should
partially restore the loser effect. Re-estimating the Wave 6 multinomial
models with COVID controls included yields results that are essentially
unchanged: the mean procedural AME moves from +0.4 to +0.5 pp, and the
mean substantive AME moves from -1.1 to -0.9 pp, with confidence
intervals that overlap substantially with the baseline estimates. The
COVID controls themselves are significant predictors of democratic
conceptions—respondents who distrust government pandemic information are
more likely to select procedural items—but their inclusion does not
eliminate the Wave 6 compression, suggesting that the pandemic effect
operates through channels beyond the two measured attitudes. Thailand
remains the clear exception: controlling for COVID perceptions leaves
the Thai loser effect essentially unchanged, consistent with the
interpretation that democratic erosion overwhelmed the pandemic’s
homogenizing pull.

Two additional concerns warrant attention. First, restricting the sample
to self-reported voters could introduce selection bias if the propensity
to vote correlates with both democratic conceptions and electoral
status. Among the countries in the analysis, non-voter rates are
generally moderate, ranging from under 10 percent in Thailand to
approximately 25 percent in select country-waves (Appendix Table H1). A
direct comparison of non-voters’ democratic conceptions to those of
winners and losers reveals that non-voters’ procedural-substantive gap
(14.3 percentage points, 95% CI: 12.7–15.8) is virtually identical to
that of winners (13.9 pp, 95% CI: 13.2–14.7) and well below that of
losers (17.3 pp, 95% CI: 16.3–18.3; Appendix Table H2). Non-voters thus
resemble winners who chose not to participate rather than alienated
citizens with suppressed procedural preferences, and their exclusion
does not inflate the estimated loser effect — if anything, it biases
against finding one, since the excluded group resembles winners
(Appendix Tables H3–H4).

Second, the use of repeated cross-sections rather than panel data means
that within-country trajectories could in principle reflect
compositional change across waves rather than genuine attitude shifts.
The Thai case offers the strongest counterargument: party loyalties in
Thailand’s color-coded politics are notably stable, and what changed
between 2010 and 2020 was not who supported which side but the
institutional context in which those loyalties were embedded. The gap’s
precise tracking of documented political events—the 2014 coup, the
prolonged period of military governance—rather than gradual demographic
shifts favors the positional interpretation over compositional
explanations.

Finally, to distinguish positional updating from stable normative
commitments, the online appendix (Section I) interacts loser status with
perceived electoral fairness. Following Mauk (2022), who shows that
electoral integrity conditions the relationship between losing and
political trust, the logic is that if the loser effect reflects
positional updating, it should intensify among losers who perceive
elections as unfair—those for whom the procedural threat is most
salient. The results are consistent with this prediction: the majority
of procedural items show a positive interaction, with particularly large
amplification for court protection and media freedom, suggesting that
the loser effect is driven by perceived procedural threat rather than
fixed orientations.

A natural extension would decompose the loser category into key
opposition supporters versus marginal party voters, testing whether the
procedural orientation is concentrated among those with a realistic path
back to power. Three-way coding (winner, key opposition, other) was
feasible for Taiwan, South Korea, and Thailand, where coalition
structures are well-documented. However, the decomposition yields no
clear differentiation: pooled across these three countries, key
opposition supporters show a mean procedural difference of −0.016
relative to winners—the opposite of the predicted direction—and the
pattern is inconsistent across countries (Appendix J, Tables J1–J2).
These null results likely reflect limited country coverage (3 of 14) and
additional missingness from party-level classification. The binary
winner-loser distinction, which the ABS pre-codes across all surveyed
countries, provides broader coverage and cleaner identification. The
three-way decomposition remains a promising avenue for future research
with more granular partisan data.

Discussion

The analysis has documented a consistent pattern across diverse Asian
political contexts: electoral losers systematically prioritize
procedural over substantive conceptions of democracy. The effect is
individually modest but collectively robust, appearing across twenty
items in five survey batteries. More importantly, it responds
dynamically to political conditions—growing dramatically in Thailand as
democratic institutions eroded.

These findings support a positional account of democratic conceptions
over alternatives emphasizing stable cultural values or fixed
psychological dispositions (Norris 2011). If conceptions of democracy
were primarily cultural inheritances, they would not shift dramatically
within countries over relatively short periods. Thailand’s
trajectory—from essentially no loser effect in 2010 to a gap exceeding
twenty percentage points by 2020—cannot be explained by slow-moving
cultural change. Nor is it plausibly compositional: Thailand’s
“color-coded” partisan alignments, rooted in regional, class, and
urban-rural cleavages, remained remarkably stable across this period
even as the parties themselves were repeatedly dissolved and
reconstituted under new names (Sinpeng 2021; McCargo 2019). What changed
between 2010 and 2020 was not who supported which side but the
institutional context in which those loyalties were embedded. Rather,
citizens appear to update their understanding of what democracy
fundamentally means in response to their changing position within the
political order—a pattern more consistent with positional updating than
with the gradual value shifts emphasized in modernization theory
(Inglehart 1997).

The results also extend the winner-loser gap literature in an important
direction. Previous research has shown that electoral status shapes
evaluations of democracy—satisfaction, trust, perceived legitimacy
(Anderson et al. 2005; Esaiasson 2011; Norris 2012)—but has assumed a
shared conception of what democracy means. The present findings suggest
that winners and losers may talk past each other when expressing views
about democracy: losers emphasizing procedures they need, winners
emphasizing outcomes they receive. This disconnect has implications for
survey research, which typically asks respondents to evaluate
“democracy” without specifying which dimension is at stake.

The governance items reveal an additional tension that deserves further
investigation. Winners’ strong preference for law and order as a
defining feature of democracy, combined with losers’ emphasis on civil
liberties and accountability, captures a fundamental strain in
democratic politics. In effect, winners exhibit a bias toward
order—conceiving of democracy as a framework for state capacity and
stability—while losers conceive of it as a framework for political
contestation and the protection of rights. Where democratic institutions
are robust, the demands for order and for contestation coexist (Slater
2010). Where they are not, this tension can become a fault line—as
Thailand’s trajectory vividly illustrates. The broader context of
democratic recession (Diamond 2015; Foa and Mounk 2016; Lührmann and
Lindberg 2019) and the mechanisms through which democracies erode
(Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018; Svolik 2019; Graham and Svolik 2020; Waldner
and Lust 2018) lend urgency to this finding: if backsliding concentrates
procedural commitments among the politically excluded, the attitudinal
foundations of democratic resilience may be weaker than aggregate
surveys suggest (Claassen 2020).

Several limitations warrant acknowledgment. First, the analysis relies
on repeated cross-sections rather than panel data, precluding direct
observation of individual-level attitude change. Within-country
trajectories are suggestive but cannot definitively rule out
compositional change across waves. The reverse-causal account—that
citizens with procedural orientations sort into losing parties—is
difficult to reconcile with the within-country trajectories. Thai
citizens did not suddenly change their party affiliations between 2010
and 2020; party loyalties in Thailand’s color-coded politics are notably
stable. What changed was the institutional context in which those
loyalties were embedded. The gap’s precise tracking of political events,
rather than gradual demographic shifts, favors the positional
interpretation.

Second, the exclusion of non-voters introduces potential selection bias,
as citizens most alienated from democratic politics may be most likely
to abstain. The findings should therefore be interpreted as
characterizing democratic conceptions among the politically engaged
electorate rather than the population at large. This is a meaningful
population in its own right—voters are the citizens whose conceptions
most directly shape democratic outcomes through their choices and
demands.

Third, the substantial weakening of the loser effect in Wave 6 across
most countries outside Thailand remains incompletely explained. The
COVID-19 pandemic, during which Wave 6 fieldwork was conducted across
all countries, likely shifted the salience of state capacity for all
citizens regardless of electoral status, temporarily compressing the
procedural-substantive gap. That Thailand’s gap grew through Wave 6
rather than compressing is itself informative: where democratic erosion
was severe enough, the positional logic overwhelmed the pandemic’s
homogenizing effect. If the pandemic explanation is correct, the loser
effect should rebound toward pre-pandemic magnitudes in post-pandemic
survey rounds — a prediction that Wave 7 of the Asian Barometer,
currently in the field, will be positioned to test directly.

Finally, with only eleven countries, the analysis cannot support strong
claims about the relationship between regime type and the loser effect
at the cross-national level; the country-level trajectories are more
informative than cross-sectional comparisons.

Conclusion

This article has argued that citizens’ position within the political
order shapes not merely their satisfaction with democracy but their
understanding of what democracy fundamentally means. Electoral losers
prioritize procedural elements—elections, civil liberties,
accountability—while winners emphasize substantive outcomes—economic
equality, welfare provision, public services. This divergence is not
merely a reflection of momentary disappointment. It represents a
coherent response to political exclusion: when denied a share of power,
the procedures that might restore it become paramount.

The within-country trajectories provide the strongest evidence for this
claim. Thailand’s decade-long shift from zero to over twenty percentage
points, tracking the progressive erosion of democratic institutions,
demonstrates that conceptions of democracy are responsive to political
conditions in ways that stable-culture or fixed-trait accounts cannot
explain. Citizens revise their understanding of democracy’s essential
features based on whether democratic procedures are delivering on their
promise of temporary, reversible exclusion from power.

One implication is troubling. Where democratic erosion creates permanent
winners and permanent losers, support for procedural democracy becomes
concentrated among those least able to defend it. The citizens who most
value free elections and civil liberties are precisely those whom the
political system has rendered powerless to demand them. Understanding
this dynamic—and whether the democratic commitments of losers can be
mobilized to resist erosion—remains among the most pressing challenges
for scholars of comparative democratization. Future research might
extend these findings in two directions: first, by examining whether
losers’ procedural orientations translate into distinct patterns of
political behavior — particularly unconventional participation such as
protest, petition, and civil disobedience — testing whether democratic
conceptions serve as blueprints for resistance rather than mere survey
artifacts; and second, by assessing whether the positional logic holds
beyond Asia, in Latin American and African democracies experiencing
their own trajectories of erosion and recovery.

A respondent-level procedural proportion score (0–1) based on up to
three codeable responses correlates at r = 0.28 with the closed-ended
item. Given the noise inherent in open-ended coding and the categorical
nature of the closed-ended measure, this represents meaningful
convergent validity.
