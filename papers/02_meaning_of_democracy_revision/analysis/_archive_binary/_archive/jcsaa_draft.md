## Abstract (150-200 words)

What does democracy mean to citizens who consistently find themselves on the losing side of elections? This article uses four waves of Asian Barometer Survey data (2005-2022, N = 34,035) to examine how electoral status shapes conceptions of democracy across Southeast and East Asia. Electoral losers, I find, consistently prioritize *procedural* elements of democracy—free elections, civil liberties, and accountability—over *substantive* outcomes like economic equality and basic needs provision. This "loser effect" appears across regime types, from consolidated democracies to competitive authoritarian systems. More strikingly, it responds to political conditions. In Thailand, as democratic institutions collapsed following the 2014 coup, the gap between winners' and losers' conceptions of democracy widened from near-zero to 17.5 percentage points. In South Korea, democratic power alternation in 2017 eliminated a previously large gap. These findings suggest that citizens' understanding of democracy is not a fixed cultural orientation but shifts with their political fortunes. For Southeast Asia's fragile democracies, this raises a troubling prospect: where electoral losing becomes permanent, procedural democracy may be valued most by those least able to defend it.

## Introduction

In May 2014, Thailand's military seized power for the second time in eight years, ousting the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra. What followed was not a swift return to civilian rule but a prolonged period of military-backed governance that continues, in modified form, to this day. For supporters of the deposed Pheu Thai party—predominantly rural and working-class voters from Thailand's north and northeast—the coup marked the beginning of a long political exile. They had won every election since 2001, yet found themselves permanently locked out of power.

How do such experiences shape what citizens believe democracy should be? This article argues that electoral exclusion fundamentally alters how citizens understand democracy itself. Using four waves of Asian Barometer Survey data spanning 17 years and more than 34,000 respondents, I show that electoral losers across Southeast and East Asia consistently prioritize *procedural* conceptions of democracy—free and fair elections, civil liberties, freedom of expression, government accountability—over *substantive* outcomes like reducing inequality or ensuring basic needs. Winners, by contrast, are more likely to define democracy in terms of what it delivers rather than how it operates.

This "loser effect" is not simply a reflection of cultural or demographic differences between winners and losers. It appears consistently across diverse political systems, from Japan's consolidated democracy to Vietnam's single-party state. And crucially, it is not static. The gap between winners' and losers' conceptions of democracy widens and narrows in response to political conditions.

Thailand offers the most dramatic illustration. In 2006, when the Asian Barometer was fielded shortly after the first coup against Thaksin Shinawatra, there was essentially no difference between winners and losers in how they understood democracy. Nearly everyone identified as a "winner"—Thaksin's coalition had dominated Thai politics—and conceptions of democracy did not vary by electoral status. By 2020, after years of military rule and the systematic exclusion of pro-Thaksin forces, the picture had transformed. Losers had become 17.5 percentage points more likely than winners to define democracy in procedural terms—a shift of more than 18 points over 14 years. As the possibility of winning through elections receded, those excluded from power increasingly valued the procedural rules that might, someday, restore their access.

South Korea presents the mirror image. During the conservative Park Geun-hye administration (2013-2017), electoral losers—supporters of the liberal opposition—were dramatically more procedural in their democratic orientations, with a gap exceeding 30 percentage points. Then came the candlelight protests, Park's impeachment, and the election of Moon Jae-in in 2017. By the time of the next survey wave, the gap had collapsed to near zero. When losing stopped being permanent, the loser effect disappeared.

These patterns have implications that extend beyond academic debates about how to measure democratic attitudes. If conceptions of democracy are shaped by political position rather than stable values, then survey measures of "democratic support" may be capturing something quite different from what researchers assume. More practically, for Southeast Asia's fragile democracies, the findings suggest a troubling dynamic. In systems like Thailand—or, increasingly, Cambodia—where one side wins permanently and the other loses permanently, support for procedural democracy becomes concentrated among the politically marginalized. Those who most value free elections and civil liberties are precisely those whom the political system has rendered unable to demand them.

The remainder of this article proceeds as follows. I first situate the argument within scholarly debates over procedural versus substantive conceptions of democracy, and the literature on winner-loser gaps in democratic attitudes. I then describe the Asian Barometer data and the measurement strategy, which uses a forced-choice battery to identify whether respondents prioritize procedural or substantive democratic values. The empirical sections present the main findings: first the overall loser effect pooled across countries and waves, then the divergent trajectories of Thailand and South Korea as contrasting case studies. I conclude by discussing what these findings mean for understanding democratic support—and democratic erosion—in contemporary Southeast Asia.

## Key Findings Summary

### Overall Loser Effect (Pooled)
- Losers 19% more likely to prioritize procedural democracy (OR = 1.19, p < 10⁻¹³)
- N = 34,035 across 14 countries, 4 waves (2005-2022)

### By Wave
| Wave | Years | Loser Effect | Significance | N |
|------|-------|--------------|--------------|---|
| W2 | 2005-08 | +6.5 pp | p < 0.001 | 9,208 |
| W3 | 2010-12 | +4.3 pp | p < 0.001 | 8,237 |
| W4 | 2014-16 | +5.1 pp | p < 0.001 | 9,828 |
| W6 | 2019-22 | -1.5 pp | n.s. | 6,762 |

### Thailand Trajectory (The Core Story)
| Wave | Year | Context | % Winners | Loser Effect |
|------|------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| W2 | 2006 | Post-coup | 95% | -0.9 pp |
| W3 | 2010 | Democrat govt | 49% | +4.6 pp |
| W4 | 2014 | Coup year | 45% | +10.6 pp |
| W6 | 2020 | Military-backed | 32% | +17.5 pp |

**Total change: +18.4 percentage points over 14 years**

### South Korea Contrast
| Wave | Year | Context | Loser Effect |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
| W3 | 2010 | Lee Myung-bak | +24.5 pp |
| W4 | 2014 | Park Geun-hye | +33.0 pp |
| W6 | 2020 | Post-Moon | -4.4 pp |

**Total change: -28.9 percentage points after democratic alternation**

## JCSAA-Specific Framing

### Regional Focus
- Lead with Thailand (Southeast Asia core case)
- Cambodia as parallel case of democratic backsliding (limited data but worth mentioning)
- Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia as comparative context
- South Korea and Taiwan as East Asian contrasts

### Policy Relevance
- Democratic backsliding is ongoing in Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar
- Understanding how exclusion shapes democratic attitudes matters for:
  - Democracy promotion efforts
  - Civil society strategy
  - Opposition movement framing
- The finding that losers value procedure suggests opposition movements should emphasize electoral fairness and civil liberties (which they often do)

### Accessibility
- Minimize jargon
- Lead with Thailand story, not regression tables
- Use figures prominently (the Thailand trajectory figure is compelling)
