## "I Don't Care How the Sausage Gets Made: Democratic Pragmatism in Asia"

## Opening Hook

When asked to choose between democracy and economic development, who is more likely to prioritize economic outcomes? Conventional wisdom—rooted in modernization theory and decades of research on authoritarian resilience—suggests citizens living under authoritarianism would be most willing to trade democratic process for material gains. After all, this is precisely the bargain authoritarian regimes offer: prosperity in exchange for political quiescence.

This paper finds the opposite. Using six waves of Asian Barometer Survey data spanning two decades (2001-2020) across 16 countries, I show that citizens in democracies are significantly *more* willing to prioritize economic outcomes over democratic process than citizens in authoritarian regimes. This "sausage mentality"—caring about what government delivers rather than how it operates—is most pronounced among the middle-educated in democracies, precisely the group modernization theory expects to be democracy's strongest defenders.

## The Puzzle

Three patterns demand explanation:

1. **The democracy paradox**: Citizens in Taiwan, South Korea, and the Philippines—established democracies—are 15-20 percentage points more likely to prioritize economy over democracy than citizens in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia.

2. **The education puzzle**: In democracies, middle-educated citizens show the strongest "sausage mentality" (68%), while the least and most educated are more pro-democracy. In authoritarian regimes, education has no such effect.

3. **Elite divergence**: Rather than converging on liberal democratic values over time, educated elites in China and Taiwan have moved in opposite directions—Chinese elites became *more* pro-democracy while Taiwanese elites became more pragmatic.

## Theoretical Framework

### The "Grass is Greener" Hypothesis

Rose, Mishler, and Haerpfer (1998), analyzing post-communist transitions, found that "people who have been denied democratic freedoms value new political rights more highly." This suggests a fundamental asymmetry: democracy is idealized when absent, taken for granted when present.

I extend this logic to Asia, where the variation in regime types and democratic experience provides a natural laboratory. The prediction: citizens in authoritarian regimes will express stronger *abstract* support for democracy (it represents an appealing alternative), while citizens in democracies will be more *pragmatic* (they live with democracy's frustrations daily).

### Democratic Disillusionment vs. Authoritarian Idealization

Chu and Diamond (2008; see also Chu, Diamond, Nathan & Shin 2008) document an apparent paradox in Asian public opinion: high levels of expressed support for democracy coexist with skepticism about democratic institutions and willingness to consider alternatives. I argue these are not contradictory but reflect different dimensions:

- **Ideological support**: Abstract belief that democracy is good ("democracy can solve problems")
- **Pragmatic orientation**: Willingness to trade democratic process for outcomes when forced to choose

Citizens can hold both simultaneously—and the gap between them may be larger in democracies, where lived experience reveals democracy's limitations, than in authoritarian regimes, where democracy remains an untested ideal.

### The Education Interaction

Why would middle-educated citizens in democracies be most "sausage-minded"? I propose a cognitive sophistication mechanism:

- **Low education**: May not fully grasp the democracy-economy tradeoff as presented; responses reflect lower political engagement rather than considered preference
- **Middle education**: Sophisticated enough to be frustrated with democratic inefficiency ("too many veto players," "nothing gets done") but lacking the civic education or historical perspective that cultivates procedural appreciation
- **High education**: More likely to have internalized democratic values through extended education; understand that democratic procedures protect against worse outcomes

In authoritarian regimes, this pattern disappears because the "grass is greener" effect dominates across all education levels—everyone idealizes the democracy they don't have.

### Elite Divergence: Against Convergence Theory

Classic modernization theory (Lipset 1959; Inglehart 1997) predicts that economic development and education produce converging values across societies—that educated Chinese and educated Taiwanese should increasingly resemble each other as both societies modernize.

I find the opposite: elite divergence. Between 2001 and 2018:
- Educated Chinese became *more* pro-democracy (61% → 47% prioritizing economy)
- Educated Taiwanese remained pragmatic (73% → 79%)
- The gap between them *tripled* from 12 to 32 percentage points

This divergence may reflect different regime trajectories:
- **China**: Xi Jinping's consolidation of power (2012-present) may have dashed rising expectations, making educated Chinese more appreciative of democratic alternatives
- **Taiwan**: Continued democratic stability allows citizens to take democracy for granted while focusing on economic performance; the 2019 Hong Kong crackdown briefly reversed this trend

### The Resignation Hypothesis: Cambodia and Vietnam

Not all authoritarian regimes follow China's pattern. In Cambodia and Vietnam, educated elites became *more* willing to trade democracy for economy over time—the opposite of China.

I propose a "resignation" mechanism: where authoritarianism is long-entrenched and elites are embedded in state patronage networks, there is no "rising expectations" to be dashed. Instead, educated citizens make peace with the regime and focus on extracting what benefits they can. This is not endorsement but pragmatic adaptation to perceived inevitability.

Cambodia is illustrative: 50 years of continuous authoritarianism (Sihanouk → Khmer Rouge → Vietnamese occupation → Hun Sen) has produced a political culture where, as one observer noted, people know that "if they just keep their mouths shut, nothing particularly bad will happen."

## Hypotheses

**H1 (Grass is Greener)**: Citizens in authoritarian regimes will express higher abstract support for democracy ("democracy can solve problems") while citizens in democracies will show greater willingness to trade democracy for economic outcomes.

**H2 (Education × Regime Interaction)**: The relationship between education and democratic pragmatism will differ by regime type:
- In democracies: inverted-U (middle education most pragmatic)
- In authoritarian regimes: flat or positive (education increases democratic idealization)

**H3 (Elite Divergence)**: Over time, educated elites across regime types will diverge rather than converge in their democratic orientations, with trajectories shaped by regime-specific dynamics.

**H4 (Resignation Effect)**: In long-entrenched authoritarian regimes with high elite-state integration (Cambodia, Vietnam), the "grass is greener" effect will weaken over time as resignation replaces aspiration.

## Contribution

This paper makes three contributions:

1. **Empirical**: Documents a robust, counterintuitive pattern—democratic citizens are more willing to trade democracy—using the most comprehensive longitudinal dataset on Asian political attitudes.

2. **Theoretical**: Extends Rose et al.'s "grass is greener" logic to Asia and identifies the conditions under which it holds (tightening authoritarianism) versus breaks down (entrenched authoritarianism with elite cooptation).

3. **Methodological**: Demonstrates the importance of distinguishing abstract democratic support from pragmatic tradeoffs—two dimensions that move independently and sometimes in opposite directions.

The findings challenge optimistic readings of modernization theory and suggest democratic consolidation may be more fragile than assumed. Citizens who *have* democracy may be its least reliable defenders.

## Notes for Revision

- Need to verify exact Chu/Diamond citations from your reading
- Consider adding Larry Diamond's "democratic recession" framing
- May want to engage with "authoritarian resilience" literature (Nathan 2003)
- The Hong Kong effect on Taiwan W6 deserves more development
- Consider whether "sausage" framing is too colloquial for journal submission
