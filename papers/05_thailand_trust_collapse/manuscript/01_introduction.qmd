# Introduction

In Wave 1 of the Asian Barometer Survey (2001–2003), Thai respondents reported the highest institutional trust in the survey's coverage: `r round(thai_mil_w1, 2)` for the military and `r round(thai_govt_w1, 2)` for the national government on a four-point scale. That baseline captured an unusual moment — the optimism of the 1997 "People's Constitution," Thaksin Shinawatra's early delivery on populist pledges, and a military that had not yet tested its reservoir of public goodwill through direct intervention [@Phongpaichit2008-wr; @McCargo2025-ke;]. The trust was diffuse: default civic confidence rooted in post-crisis renewal rather than considered institutional judgment.

Two decades later, both had collapsed — government trust to `r round(thai_govt_w6, 2)`, military trust to `r round(thai_mil_w6, 2)`. No other country in the ABS's longitudinal coverage underwent a reversal of this magnitude. But the more consequential finding is not the endpoint. It is the shape of the journey. Trust did not erode steadily across two decades of political turbulence. It held — remarkably stable through two coups, a five-year military government, and a manipulated election — before collapsing catastrophically between Waves 5 and 6. The share of Thai respondents reporting no military trust at all stood between `r round(bb_th_mil_min_w1_5, 0)`% and `r round(bb_th_mil_max_w1_5, 0)`% across Waves 1 through 5. In Wave 6, it reached `r round(bb_th_mil_w6, 0)`%.

This paper documents that collapse and argues for a specific account of its causes. The timing and institutional structure of the decline point to the 2020–2021 pro-democracy protests as the proximate shock. Those protests were qualitatively distinct from the Red Shirt mobilizations of the preceding decade. Where the earlier conflict was partisan — organized around support for Thaksin-aligned parties against a royalist-military establishment — the 2020–2021 movement explicitly targeted the military-monarchy nexus itself [@Sinpeng2021-hd; @McCargo2021-na; @Unno2021-to].

Its three core demands — dissolving parliament, ending military interference, and reforming the monarchy's political role — named the institutional architecture that successive coups had built. This directness was in part enabled by a structural change in Thai politics that surveys cannot directly observe: the death of King Bhumibol in 2016 and the accession of King Vajiralongkorn removed the legitimating buffer through which the military had historically derived diffuse public deference [@Chambers2016-ao]; @Ganjanakhundee2022-jw]. Where Bhumibol had ruled through networks and proxies, lending the military a form of monarchical legitimacy that insulated both institutions from scrutiny, Vajiralongkorn intervened directly — consolidating Crown Property Bureau assets, transferring army units to royal command, and amending the constitution to expand royal prerogatives — transforming the monarchy from a source of military legitimacy into a focal point of protest demands.

The ABS data cannot directly measure attitudes toward the monarchy. What they can measure — and what this paper documents — is the mass-level consequence for the institutions most implicated in that political rupture. Military trust bore the heaviest losses, falling approximately 1.5 times more than government trust. This institutional differentiation is the paper's central empirical discriminant: a pandemic performance story predicts government trust should decline more sharply, since civilian administrations bear primary responsibility for policy outcomes; a political crisis story predicts military trust should decline more, since the protests explicitly targeted the armed forces' political role. The data support the latter unambiguously.

Three additional findings anchor the analysis. Pre-trend models confirm that Thai military trust was actually rising through Wave 4 (2014–2016), ruling out secular decline and pointing to discrete shocks rather than accumulated drift. Geographic analysis reveals that the steepest collapses occurred in Bangkok and the Northeast — the protest epicenter and the Thaksin heartland respectively — demonstrating that the 2020–2021 movement transcended the Red Shirt–Yellow Shirt divide that had structured Thai politics since 2006. And attitudinal evidence shows that rejection of authoritarian rule rose over the same period that institutional trust collapsed, suggesting democratic maturation rather than generalized cynicism: Thais were not withdrawing from politics, but applying increasingly demanding standards to institutions they perceived as violating democratic norms.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on institutional trust in democratizing Asia and develops the competing explanatory frameworks. Section 3 presents data and methods. Section 4 reports results across five hypothesis tests. Section 5 discusses theoretical implications and Section 6 concludes.
