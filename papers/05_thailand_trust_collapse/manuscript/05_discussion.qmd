# Discussion

The preceding analysis establishes three core findings. First, Thailand experienced the steepest institutional trust decline in the ABS's two-decade history, a trajectory that is statistically distinguishable from the Philippines and Taiwan across multiple model specifications. Second, this decline was institutionally differentiated: military trust fell approximately `r round(thai_mil_govt_ratio, 1)` times more than government trust, with the sharpest acceleration concentrated in the Wave 5--6 period coinciding with the 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests. Third, the pattern survives controls for economic and democratic performance satisfaction and cannot be attributed to pre-existing secular trends, given that Thai military trust was actually *rising* through Wave 4. In this section, we discuss what these findings mean for competing theories of trust change, for the study of civil-military relations in hybrid regimes, and for the broader comparative literature on institutional legitimacy in Asia.

## Political Crisis vs. Performance Explanations

The government-military trust differential provides a discriminating test between performance and political crisis accounts of institutional trust change. A performance explanation, whether rooted in economic governance, pandemic management, or service delivery, would predict that government trust should be the primary casualty, since elected officials and their appointed bureaucracies bear direct responsibility for policy outcomes. The military, by contrast, plays at most a supporting role in pandemic response and economic management, and should therefore be relatively insulated from performance-based updating.

The data reject this prediction decisively. Military trust declined more steeply than government trust in Thailand, and this differential widened sharply in the Wave 5--6 period. Adding controls for economic satisfaction and democracy satisfaction, the two most commonly used performance proxies in the trust literature, leaves the pattern essentially unchanged. If Thai respondents were punishing institutions for poor governance, the punishment fell disproportionately on an institution that does not govern in the conventional sense. This is difficult to reconcile with any standard performance model.

The political crisis framework, by contrast, accounts for the observed pattern straightforwardly. The 2020--2021 protests represented the most direct challenge to military political influence since the 2010 Red Shirt mobilization, but with an important difference: the protest coalition was broader, younger, and more ideologically coherent in its demands [@Sinpeng2021-hd]. The three core demands (dissolving parliament, ending military interference, and reforming the monarchy's political role) explicitly targeted the institutional architecture that the military had built through successive coups and constitutional engineering. Our finding that military trust collapsed precisely in this period, and that the collapse was steepest among younger and more educated respondents, is consistent with a mechanism in which political mobilization catalyzed a reassessment of the military's institutional legitimacy.

Multiple convergent patterns support the protest-driven mechanism over alternative accounts: (1) temporal discontinuity, with pre-trend analysis showing military trust rising before reversing sharply; (2) institutional specificity, with military trust declining approximately `r round(thai_mil_govt_ratio, 1)` times more than government trust; (3) geographic concentration, with the steepest declines in Bangkok and the Northeast, the protest epicenter and the Thaksin heartland; (4) demographic gradients consistent with protest participation, with youth-led erosion that nonetheless diffused broadly across all subgroups; and (5) attitudinal alignment, with democratic commitment predicting steeper military trust decline over time. While no single pattern is definitive, their conjunction strengthens causal inference considerably beyond timing alone.

This is not to say that performance played no role. The COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly contributed to economic hardship and political frustration, and the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. However, the institutional differentiation pattern suggests that pandemic-related grievances were *channeled through* political crisis rather than operating as an independent driver. Respondents who were dissatisfied with pandemic governance appear to have attributed responsibility to the military-backed political system rather than to the civilian administrative apparatus alone. This channeling effect, in which performance failures amplify political grievances rather than generating independent trust dynamics, deserves further investigation in other hybrid regime contexts.

## The Paradox of Military Intervention

Thailand's trajectory illustrates a paradox that has received insufficient attention in the civil-military relations literature: prolonged military involvement in governance can erode the very institutional trust that initially legitimized intervention. Indonesia's post-Suharto military reforms demonstrate that this outcome is not inevitable—where armed forces credibly withdraw from politics, institutional trust can be preserved [@Mietzner2008-hq]—yet Thailand's failure to achieve such withdrawal makes it a paradigmatic case of the legitimacy trap. In 2001, Thai military trust stood at `r round(thai_mil_w1, 2)` on a four-point scale, the highest among our three comparison countries. This figure should not be read as evidence of deep, considered confidence in the armed forces' governance capacity. Rather, the 2001 baseline captured a moment of diffuse institutional trust inflated by post-crisis optimism: the 1997 reform constitution had generated hope for democratic renewal, Thaksin's government was delivering visible policy benefits, and the military had not yet tested its reservoir of public goodwill through direct intervention. Military prestige rested on its long-cultivated association with the monarchy and a self-presentation as a stabilizing force above partisan politics [@McCargo2005-zj; @Chambers2014-ty], a posture that commanded deference precisely because it had not been subjected to the scrutiny that active governance invites. This reservoir of diffuse trust provided the legitimating basis for the 2006 coup, which enjoyed significant public support, particularly among Bangkok's middle classes.

Yet each subsequent intervention drew down this reservoir without replenishing it. The 2006 coup was followed by political instability rather than the stability it promised. The 2014 coup extended into five years of direct military governance, during which the armed forces became inextricable from routine political administration: managing the economy, drafting a constitution designed to preserve their influence, and suppressing dissent. By the time of the 2019 elections, the military was no longer an institution that occasionally intervened in politics; it was a permanent political actor with identifiable policy preferences, factional alliances, and constitutional privileges.

This transformation from arbiter to actor carries a predictable cost. Institutions that claim legitimacy on the basis of neutrality and competence are vulnerable when they are perceived as partisan and self-interested. Our data suggest that this perception shift occurred gradually through the 2006--2019 period and then crystallized rapidly during the 2020--2021 protests, when the military's political role became the explicit target of mass mobilization. The pre-trend analysis is revealing on this point: military trust was still *rising* through Wave 4 (2014--2016), suggesting that the 2014 coup may have initially been perceived as stabilizing, much like the 2006 coup. The subsequent collapse in Waves 5--6 suggests that the costs of intervention accumulated and then became apparent in a relatively compressed period.

Comparative evidence from our other cases reinforces this interpretation. Taiwan's military trust shows no significant trend over the period, consistent with successful depoliticization following democratization: the armed forces were removed from partisan politics through institutional reforms in the 1990s and have not intervened since [@Croissant2013-ly]. The Philippines presents a more complex case, where military and police trust remained stable or rose slightly during the Duterte period, arguably reflecting preference alignment under a leader who actively endorsed coercive institutions. Thailand's trajectory suggests that such alignment is fragile: trust built on political association can collapse when the political winds shift.

The broader implication is that military coups may generate short-term trust gains but long-term trust deficits. Each intervention politicizes the military further, making it harder to return to the apolitical posture on which diffuse trust depends. Thailand's two-decade trajectory may represent the natural endpoint of this dynamic: a military that has intervened so often and governed so long that it has exhausted the institutional legitimacy that made intervention viable in the first place.

## The Philippines: Coercive Legitimacy and Preference Alignment

The Philippine findings merit sustained comparative attention. The stability of coercive institutional trust during the Duterte period challenges simplified accounts that equate authoritarian governance with trust erosion. Rather, the Philippine case demonstrates that the relationship between coercive state action and institutional trust is mediated by preference alignment. That trust rose uniformly across sensitive and non-sensitive institutions suggests that Duterte's legitimacy was not confined to the security apparatus but permeated the broader institutional landscape. The Philippine pattern aligns with what Levitsky and Loxton [-@Levitsky2013-nc] term the electoral foundations of authoritarian populism, in which leaders who deliver visible, if coercive, policy outcomes generate broad-based institutional legitimacy. When Duterte launched the drug war in 2016, he did so with broad popular mandate and sustained majority approval ratings [@Teehankee2016-xm; @Curato2016-kl]. The police, despite being implicated in thousands of extrajudicial killings, were perceived as acting on behalf of citizen preferences rather than against them.

This contrast with Thailand is instructive for comparative theory. In Thailand, the military's political interventions increasingly contradicted growing democratic expectations; in the Philippines, the police's coercive action aligned with popular demands for order. The trust consequences diverged accordingly. This finding suggests that the critical variable is not the severity of coercive action per se, but the degree to which such action is perceived as responsive to citizen preferences, a formulation that bridges the institutional trust literature with research on populist authoritarian legitimacy [@Pernia2023-po].

Two caveats temper this interpretation. First, the ABS data cannot distinguish between genuine popular endorsement of the drug war and preference falsification under conditions of intimidation. If Filipinos who opposed the drug war were reluctant to express distrust in the police during face-to-face interviews, the apparent stability of police trust may overstate actual support. Second, the Duterte period represents a relatively short window (Waves 4--5); whether coercive legitimacy alignment can sustain trust over longer periods remains an open question that subsequent ABS waves may help resolve.

## Generational Dynamics and the Future of Thai Institutional Trust

The subgroup analyses reveal an important generational dimension that merits separate discussion. Younger respondents, those most likely to have participated in or sympathized with the 2020--2021 protests, show the steepest military trust declines, but the erosion is present across all age cohorts. This suggests a combination of cohort and period effects: the protests were led by younger Thais, but the underlying disillusionment with military governance was broadly shared [@Sinpeng2021-hd].

This pattern has implications for the durability of the trust collapse. If the decline were confined to a single generational cohort, one might expect recovery as that cohort ages and new cohorts with different formative experiences enter the electorate. However, the cross-cohort character of the decline suggests a more fundamental shift in how Thai citizens evaluate the military's institutional role. The 2023 general election, in which the progressive Move Forward Party won the most seats on a platform of military reform and structural change, provides suggestive out-of-sample evidence that the attitudinal shifts documented here have behavioral consequences, though confirming this link requires individual-level data that the ABS cannot provide.

## Democratic Expectation Updating and Political Learning

The attitudinal mechanism findings strengthen the theoretical core of the paper. The concurrent rise in rejection of authoritarian rule and decline in institutional trust in Thailand supports the democratic expectation updating interpretation over alternative accounts. If trust decline reflected mere political cynicism or democratic fatigue, we would expect rejection of authoritarian alternatives to decline in parallel, with citizens losing faith in all institutions and all governance models simultaneously. Instead, we observe a pattern consistent with democratic maturation: Thais increasingly rejected authoritarian governance in principle while withdrawing trust from institutions they perceived as practicing it.

The political interest findings add a micro-level mechanism to this macro-level pattern. Politically engaged citizens, those most exposed to information about the military's political role and most likely to apply democratic evaluative standards, drove the trust decline disproportionately. This finding connects to @Shin2005-wd's research on democratic learning in Asia, which argues that democratic experience fundamentally reshapes citizens' cognitive frameworks for evaluating governance. Our contribution is to demonstrate that this learning process can generate institutionally differentiated trust outcomes: democratic learning does not erode trust uniformly but targets the specific institutions perceived as violating democratic norms.

## Implications for the Comparative Study of Trust

Our findings contribute to several ongoing debates in the comparative trust literature. First, they challenge the assumption that institutional trust in Asian societies is primarily performance-driven. The influential "Asian values" framework and its successors have emphasized the role of economic delivery in sustaining regime legitimacy across diverse institutional forms [@Shin2007-gu; @Shin2008-gu]. Thailand's case demonstrates that political legitimacy concerns, specifically perceptions of institutional neutrality and democratic accountability, can override performance evaluations as drivers of trust, even in a middle-income Asian context.

Second, the institutional differentiation pattern underscores the importance of disaggregating trust measures. Much of the comparative literature treats institutional trust as a composite index or focuses on a single institution, typically the national government or parliament. Our analysis shows that the government-military differential carries substantial theoretical information that is lost in aggregation. Had we examined only government trust, Thailand's decline would have appeared significant but not exceptional; it is the military-specific collapse that marks Thailand as an outlier and points toward the political crisis mechanism.

Third, the findings speak to debates about the relationship between trust and democratic consolidation. Declining trust is often interpreted as a symptom of democratic malaise, but in Thailand's case, the pattern may be more ambiguous. If military trust is eroding because citizens increasingly reject military involvement in politics, this could reflect *democratic deepening*, a growing insistence on civilian supremacy and democratic accountability, rather than institutional decay. The distinction matters for how scholars and policymakers interpret trust data: not all trust declines are symptoms of democratic erosion, and not all trust is democratically desirable.

## Limitations

Several limitations qualify our findings and point toward productive extensions. First, the repeated cross-sectional design prevents us from tracking individual-level trust dynamics. We observe that aggregate military trust collapsed in Waves 5--6, but we cannot determine whether this reflects widespread individual-level updating, compositional change in survey participation, or some combination. Panel data, or at minimum repeated surveys of the same sampling units, would strengthen causal inference considerably.

Second, our three-country comparison, while analytically powerful for the specific contrasts we draw, limits the generalizability of our findings. Thailand, the Philippines, and Taiwan were selected because they are the only countries with complete ABS coverage, not because they represent the full range of Asian political systems. Countries with comparable experiences of military governance (Myanmar, Indonesia, Pakistan) might exhibit similar trust dynamics, but confirming this requires data that are not currently available in a consistent cross-national framework.

Third, we rely on ecological inference to link aggregate trust patterns to individual-level mechanisms. We argue that the military-government differential reflects political crisis rather than performance, but we do not directly observe individual attitudes toward the military's political role or the 2020--2021 protests. The subgroup analyses provide some leverage (the finding that younger, more educated respondents show steeper declines is consistent with the political crisis mechanism), but they do not eliminate the possibility that unmeasured confounders drive the observed patterns.

Fourth, the ABS trust measure is a four-point scale with limited granularity. Floor and ceiling effects may attenuate estimated declines for countries that start near the extremes, and respondents may interpret the scale differently across countries and time periods. The ordered logit robustness check addresses the linearity assumption but cannot resolve cross-cultural measurement equivalence concerns.

Fifth, response bias concerns apply to both countries. In Thailand, government repression of protests may have inhibited critical responses in Wave 6 face-to-face interviews, though this would understate rather than overstate our findings. In the Philippines, intimidation under Duterte may have inflated reported police trust. However, the institutional differentiation pattern (military-specific decline in Thailand, police stability in the Philippines) is inconsistent with generalized interviewer effects, which would affect all trust measures similarly.

Finally, our analysis ends in 2022, and subsequent political developments provide natural extensions of the theoretical framework developed here. The 2023 general election, in which the progressive Move Forward Party won the most seats on a platform of military reform before being judicially dissolved, offers suggestive evidence that the trust dynamics documented in this paper have behavioral consequences. More consequentially for the democratic expectation updating framework, the February 2026 general election—held following a brief border conflict with Cambodia that created conditions for nationalist mobilization—provides a particularly informative out-of-sample test. If democratic expectation updating has durably raised evaluative thresholds, the framework generates three specific predictions: (1) no major constituency should rally to explicitly defend military political prerogatives, even under nationalist mobilization conditions; (2) younger cohorts should remain resistant to authoritarian appeals; and (3) any trust restoration should be conditional on perceived institutional reform rather than performative nationalism.

Preliminary evidence from the 2026 election is broadly consistent with these predictions, though it also reveals important scope conditions.^[Seat counts draw on preliminary results from the Election Commission of Thailand (February 2026). Turnout figures and election conduct assessments draw on @ANFREL2026-xb, which reported a provisional turnout of 65--70 percent across the concurrent parliamentary elections and constitutional referendum. Party-level demographic characterizations are drawn from Thai news reporting and should be treated as provisional pending academic analysis of final results.] The nationalist-conservative Bhumjaithai Party won a decisive plurality (193 seats), drawing disproportionately from older, rural voters—the demographic profile our framework identifies as most susceptible to rally effects and least exposed to the cognitive mobilization dynamics described above. Critically, however, Bhumjaithai's appeal rested on populist economic promises and cultural conservatism rather than explicit endorsement of military political prerogatives, consistent with prediction (1). The revived Democrat Party (22 seats) attracted a segment of younger, urban voters who had previously supported progressive alternatives, but post-election analysis characterized this constituency as seeking "clean governance" in explicit opposition to the leading conservative coalition rather than endorsing the institutional status quo. The People's Party retained its base among younger voters committed to structural reform. No major electoral constituency mobilized in defense of the military-backed institutional order per se.

This fragmentation pattern is itself theoretically informative. Rather than reversing democratic learning, the 2026 election reveals its differentiation across competing reform pathways: radical constitutional change (People's Party), incremental reform within existing constraints (Democrats), and populist economic redistribution without structural institutional challenge (Bhumjaithai). The democratic expectation updating framework does not predict unanimous opposition to military influence, but rather that the evaluative threshold shift should be durable and that trust restoration should require substantive rather than symbolic institutional change. Future ABS waves will be essential for determining whether these electoral patterns correspond to the institutional trust dynamics documented here, and whether the shift from diffuse to conditional trust that we identify proves as durable as the theory predicts. The National Anti-Corruption Commission's February 9 verdict finding 44 former Move Forward MPs guilty of ethical violations for legislative speech acts—potentially disqualifying 15 People's Party incumbents and banning them from politics—illustrates precisely the institutional resistance that the democratic expectation updating framework predicts: an institutional order under legitimacy pressure deploying formal legal mechanisms to constrain the reform coalitions that trust erosion has empowered [@ANFREL2026-xb].
