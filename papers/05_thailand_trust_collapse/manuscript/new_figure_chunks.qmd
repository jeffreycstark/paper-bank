     §4.3  INSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION (H2)
     INSERT this chunk immediately BEFORE tbl-h2-threeway.
     Replace the current opening descriptive paragraph with a forward
     reference to the figure, then let the table provide the formal test.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

```{r fig-h2-gap, out.width="100%"}
#| fig-cap: >
#|   Thailand's military and government trust trajectories (W1–W6).
#|   Shaded ribbon marks the growing gap between institutions; 95% CI bands
#|   shown. Military trust fell 1.5 times more than government trust
#|   (three-way interaction *p* < .001), inconsistent with pandemic performance
#|   accounts (which predict the reverse) and consistent with the political
#|   crisis interpretation (H2).
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_dir, "fig5_h2_mil_govt_gap.png"))
```

<!--
REVISED PROSE to follow the figure (replaces current "descriptive evidence
already suggests" paragraph):

Figure 3 makes the institutional differentiation pattern immediately visible.
Military trust began Wave 1 marginally above government trust and the two
series tracked closely through Wave 3 before diverging sharply. The formal
test is reported in @tbl-h2-threeway.
-->


<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     §4.4  PRE-TREND AND CAUSAL IDENTIFICATION
     INSERT fig-pretrend-reversal BEFORE tbl-pretrend.
     Then keep tbl-pretrend, followed immediately by tbl-did
     (moved up from the Robustness section).
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

```{r fig-pretrend-reversal, out.width="100%"}
#| fig-cap: >
#|   Thai military trust was statistically *rising* (β = positive) through
#|   Wave 4 before collapsing to 1.62 in Wave 6. The dashed line projects
#|   the pre-Wave 4 trajectory forward as a counterfactual; the actual W5–W6
#|   values fall dramatically below this projection. The shaded regions
#|   distinguish the pre-shock era (green) from the protest era (red).
#|   This reversal rules out secular decline as an explanation and points
#|   to a discrete political shock (pre-trend coefficient *p* < .001).
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_dir, "fig6_pretrend_reversal.png"))
```

<!--
PROSE NOTE: after this figure, keep tbl-pretrend as-is, then move tbl-did
immediately after (before Performance Controls). The DiD pairs naturally
with pre-trend: both address identification. The Robustness section then
becomes tbl-secondary + tbl-ologit only.
-->


<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     §4.6  PHILIPPINES: COERCIVE LEGITIMACY ALIGNMENT (H3)
     INSERT at the start of the H3 section, before the formal test prose.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

```{r fig-th-ph-coercive, out.width="100%"}
#| fig-cap: >
#|   Panel A: Thailand's military and government trust trajectories (W1–W6).
#|   Panel B: Philippines military and police trust trajectories (W1–W6).
#|   Shaded region marks the Duterte era (PH, W4–W6) and protest era (TH,
#|   W4–W6). Where state coercion aligned with mass preferences (Philippines),
#|   coercive institutional trust held or rose. Where it violated democratic
#|   expectations (Thailand), it collapsed. The contrast provides scope
#|   conditions for the coercive legitimacy mechanism (H3).
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_dir, "fig7_th_ph_coercive.png"))
```

<!--
PROSE NOTE: This figure now carries the H3 visual burden. The paragraph
about the formal null result (stacked model, wave × coercive interaction
non-significant) can follow the figure as interpretive context.
The current opening sentence "The Philippine case provides a theoretically
informative contrast" works well as the figure's lead-in.
-->


<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     §4.7  ATTITUDINAL MECHANISMS (H4 and H5)
     INSERT at the start of this section, before the rejection-of-military-rule
     prose paragraph.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

```{r fig-expectations-divergence, out.width="100%"}
#| fig-cap: >
#|   Thailand W1–W6: military trust (red, declining; H1) plotted against
#|   rejection of military rule (blue, rising; H4). Both variables use the
#|   same 1–4 scale. The scissors pattern — trust falling as democratic norms
#|   rise — is inconsistent with generalized political cynicism (which would
#|   produce parallel declines) and consistent with democratic expectation
#|   updating: citizens are applying increasingly demanding evaluative
#|   standards to institutions they perceive as violating democratic norms.
#|   Vertical dashed line marks the 2014 coup. 95% CI bands shown.
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_dir, "fig8_expectations_divergence.png"))
```

<!--
PROSE NOTE: This figure can replace or precede the current opening paragraph
of §4.7. The key numbers (e.g., thai_reject_mil_w1, thai_reject_mil_w6)
remain in the inline text for precision; the figure carries the visual logic.

     §4.8  REGIONAL VARIATION
     REPLACE tbl-regional-means with this figure (move the table to the
     Online Appendix), or place the figure before the table if the editor
     requires it.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

```{r fig-regional-decline, out.width="90%"}
#| fig-cap: >
#|   Military trust by Thai region across Waves 4–6 (region identifiers
#|   available W4–W6 only; *N* = 3,301). Regions are ordered left-to-right
#|   by magnitude of W4–W6 decline. Bangkok (protest epicenter) and the
#|   Northeast (Thaksin heartland) declined equally and most steeply, despite
#|   representing historically opposing sides of the Red Shirt–Yellow Shirt
#|   divide. The South (royalist stronghold) showed the smallest decline.
#|   This geographic pattern is inconsistent with pandemic performance accounts
#|   (which would predict uniform regional patterns) and consistent with
#|   politically structured trust erosion.
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_dir, "fig9_regional_decline.png"))
```

<!--
PROSE NOTE: The current tbl-regional-means can move to Online Appendix as
"Table A-X: Military trust means by region and wave." The regression results
(reg_bkk_vs_south, reg_ne_vs_south, etc.) remain as inline text.
