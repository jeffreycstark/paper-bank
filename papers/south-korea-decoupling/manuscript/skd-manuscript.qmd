  Democratic consolidation theory predicts that satisfaction with democratic performance and normative commitment to democracy move in tandem, mutually reinforcing one another as democracies mature. Six waves of Asian Barometer Survey data from South Korea (2003--2022, *n* = 7,603) reveal a striking dissociation: democratic satisfaction has risen steadily (+0.049 normalized units per decade) while the belief that democracy is always preferable has declined (--0.098/decade). Wave-by-wave OLS regressions demonstrate that economic evaluations are powerful predictors of satisfaction with democracy ($\beta$ = 0.26--0.46, *p* < 0.001 across all waves) but have no significant relationship with normative democratic preference from 2006 onward ($\beta$ \approx 0, all *p* > 0.10). A parallel analysis of Taiwan (*n* = 9,042) reveals a fundamentally different syndrome: economic evaluations predict satisfaction *and* are significantly negatively associated with normative democratic preference ($\beta$ = --0.14 to --0.50), consistent with a critical citizens pattern. The cross-country difference is statistically significant (interaction $\beta$ = 0.217, *p* < 0.001). These findings challenge the assumption that democratic satisfaction signals democratic deepening, identify two distinct legitimation pathways in East Asia's most-studied democracies, and illuminate the conditions under which democratic institutions may be resilient yet normatively shallow---as illustrated by South Korea's December 2024 martial law crisis.

# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

On the evening of December 3, 2024, President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared on national television to declare emergency martial law in South Korea, citing the need to protect the country from "anti-state forces" and "North Korean communist sympathizers" allegedly operating through the opposition-controlled National Assembly [@Hankyoreh2024-fx]. Troops were dispatched to the parliament building; political activity was banned; the press was placed under the authority of the Martial Law Command. It was the first declaration of martial law in South Korea since Chun Doo-hwan's military coup in 1980---and it lasted barely six hours. Lawmakers pushed past soldiers, convened an emergency session, and voted unanimously to overturn the decree. Yoon was impeached within days. In February 2026, a Seoul court sentenced him to life in prison for insurrection, the most severe punishment imposed on a former president in the post-democratization era [@Hankyoreh2026-aa]. South Korean democracy, by any institutional measure, held.

Yet the episode raises a question that institutional resilience alone cannot answer. How could a sitting president---a former chief prosecutor, educated entirely within democratic South Korea's legal institutions---conclude that martial law was a viable political strategy in the world's tenth-largest economy and one of Asia's most celebrated democracies? The standard answer points to Yoon's personal authoritarian tendencies and his administration's political isolation, with approval ratings as low as ten percent. This paper offers a complementary structural explanation grounded in two decades of mass public opinion data. It argues that the foundation of democratic support in South Korea is more fragile than the institutional performance of its democracy suggests, because that support rests primarily on performance-derived legitimation rather than normative democratic commitment.

The empirical basis for this argument is a pattern this paper terms the *satisfaction paradox*. Drawing on six waves of the Asian Barometer Survey spanning 2003 to 2022 (*n* = `r n_kr` for South Korea), the analysis documents a sustained divergence between two dimensions of democratic support that consolidation theory predicts should move together. Democratic satisfaction---citizens' evaluations of how well democracy is performing---has risen steadily over the observation period, increasing at approximately `r .slope("Satisfaction")` normalized units per decade. Normative democratic commitment---the belief that democracy is always preferable---has simultaneously declined at --`r abs(.slope("Democratic quality"))` units per decade, while system support declined at --0.045 per decade. Korean citizens have become more satisfied with their democracy while becoming less committed to it as a form of government.

The mechanism underlying this paradox is straightforward. Wave-by-wave regression models demonstrate that economic evaluations are powerful and consistent predictors of satisfaction with democracy ($\beta$ = `r .wi_range("Korea", "sat_democracy_n")`, *p* < 0.001 across all six waves) but have no statistically significant relationship with normative democratic preference from 2006 onward. Satisfaction runs on an economic track; normative commitment runs on a separate track entirely. Whatever determines whether Korean citizens believe democracy is worth defending in principle, it is not economic performance.

This finding acquires comparative depth when set alongside a parallel analysis of Taiwan (*n* = `r n_tw` across the same six ABS waves). Taiwan shares South Korea's developmental state heritage, Confucian cultural matrix, and third-wave democratization experience, yet the Taiwanese data reveal a fundamentally different syndrome. As in Korea, economic evaluations predict democratic satisfaction. But in Taiwan, economic evaluations are also significantly and *negatively* associated with normative democratic preference ($\beta$ = `r { vals <- wi |> filter(country=="Taiwan", dv=="qual_pref_dem_n", p.value<0.05) |> pull(estimate); paste0(round(max(vals),2), " to ", round(min(vals),2)) }`): economically comfortable Taiwanese citizens are substantially *more* committed to democracy as a matter of principle. The cross-country difference is statistically significant (interaction $\beta$ = `r .xci_b("qual_pref_dem_n", "econ_index:is_korea")`, *p* `r .xci_p("qual_pref_dem_n", "econ_index:is_korea")`). Where Korean citizens exhibit decoupled satisfaction and normative commitment, Taiwanese citizens exhibit what Norris [-@Norris1999-sn; -@Norris2011-oc] theorized as critical citizenship---and they do so to a degree not previously documented in the East Asian survey literature.

This paper argues that the divergence reflects two distinct pathways of democratic legitimation. In South Korea, democracy arrived as an instrument of accountability and economic governance, and democratic support has remained fundamentally instrumental---conditional on continued delivery, shallow in normative depth, and vulnerable to disruption when performance falters or alternative governance models become attractive. In Taiwan, democratization became fused with national identity through the political project of distinguishing Taiwan from authoritarian China, anchoring normative democratic commitment independently of economic performance and producing a citizenry that grows more demanding of democratic quality as material conditions improve.

The paper makes three contributions. First, it documents the satisfaction-quality dissociation in South Korea with systematic longitudinal evidence, demonstrating that rising democratic satisfaction does not indicate democratic deepening. Second, it identifies the performance-derived legitimation mechanism at the individual level, showing that economic evaluations are strongly associated with the satisfaction dimension while showing no relationship with normative commitment. Third, it demonstrates through formal comparative analysis that the Korean pattern is not a generic East Asian phenomenon but a consequence of Korea's specific legitimation pathway, distinguishable from Taiwan's identity-fused alternative at conventional levels of statistical significance.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. @sec-theory reviews the consolidation literature's co-movement assumption and develops the theoretical framework distinguishing performance-derived from identity-fused democratic legitimation. @sec-methods describes the data, variable construction, and analytic strategy. @sec-results presents the descriptive trends, mechanism tests, cross-country comparison, and robustness checks. @sec-discussion interprets the findings, addresses their implications for democratic resilience in light of the Yoon crisis, and acknowledges limitations. @sec-conclusion offers concluding reflections.


# Literature Review and Theoretical Framework {#sec-theory}

## Democratic consolidation and the co-movement assumption {#sec-theory-consolidation}

The study of democratic consolidation has long rested on a distinction between two modes of citizen support for democracy. Easton's [-@Easton1965-ap] foundational framework distinguished *diffuse support*---a reservoir of generalized attachment to the political system that persists independent of specific policy outcomes---from *specific support*---evaluations of incumbent performance that fluctuate with economic conditions, policy decisions, and government competence. Consolidation, in this framework, occurs when diffuse support becomes sufficiently deep and widely distributed that the democratic regime can weather periods of poor specific support without existential threat. The system is legitimate not because it performs well at any given moment but because citizens regard it as the only acceptable form of governance.

Subsequent consolidation theorists elaborated this distinction into a set of empirical expectations about how democratic attitudes should evolve over time. Linz and Stepan [-@Linz1996-qs] argued that consolidation requires democracy to become "the only game in town"---behaviorally, attitudinally, and constitutionally. Diamond [-@Diamond1999-wd] theorized a process of democratic "deepening" in which institutional maturation produces progressively stronger normative commitment among mass publics. The implicit prediction common to these accounts is one of *co-movement*: as democracies deliver on their promise of accountable governance, citizen satisfaction with democratic performance should reinforce citizen commitment to democratic principles, generating a virtuous cycle in which good performance builds legitimacy and strong legitimacy buffers the system against performance downturns. Specific and diffuse support, in short, should trend in the same direction over the medium to long term.

Norris's [-@Norris1999-sn; -@Norris2011-oc] work on "critical citizens" introduced an important qualification. Drawing on survey evidence from advanced industrialized democracies, Norris observed that citizens in mature democracies were becoming simultaneously more committed to democratic ideals and more dissatisfied with democratic practice---a combination she attributed to rising expectations that outpaced institutional performance. Crucially, however, the critical citizens thesis does not challenge the fundamental co-movement assumption so much as it refines the mechanism. In Norris's framework, the normative dimension is secure and indeed strengthening; it is the performance evaluation that grows more demanding. The foundation of democratic legitimacy remains normative, and the growth of critical evaluation is itself a sign of democratic health rather than vulnerability.

The more radical challenge to co-movement---the possibility that satisfaction and normative commitment might not merely decouple but move in *opposite directions*---has received less systematic theoretical attention. Foa and Mounk [-@Foa2017-oq] provoked considerable debate by documenting declining support for democracy among younger cohorts in the United States and Western Europe, but their analysis focused on generational replacement rather than the performance-commitment relationship, and the empirical claims themselves have been contested [see @Voeten2016-qb]. The question of whether a mature democracy can exhibit rising satisfaction alongside declining normative commitment---and what such a configuration would imply for democratic resilience---remains undertheorized.

## Performance legitimacy and the East Asian challenge {#sec-theory-eastasia}

The co-movement assumption developed primarily from the experience of Western democracies in which democratic legitimacy was established before or alongside industrialization, and in which civic education, constitutional veneration, and foundational political narratives anchored normative democratic commitment independently of economic performance. The East Asian democratization experience challenges this sequence. In South Korea, Taiwan, and the other third-wave democracies of the region, rapid economic development under authoritarian auspices preceded democratic transition, creating a context in which citizens had already experienced effective governance without democracy and in which democracy's legitimacy was inevitably, at least in part, comparative---measured against the developmental state it replaced.

A substantial body of scholarship has documented the consequences of this sequencing for democratic attitudes in East Asia. Park and Shin [-@Park2006-bv], drawing on Asian Barometer data, identified what they termed "incomplete democratization" in South Korea, characterized by widespread preference for democratic governance coexisting with substantial reservoirs of authoritarian nostalgia and limited understanding of democracy in procedural terms. Chu and colleagues [-@Chu2008-fk; -@Chu2020-ir], in broader comparative analyses of ABS data, showed that citizens across East Asia tended to define democracy in substantive rather than procedural terms---emphasizing economic outcomes, social harmony, and good governance over elections, rights, and institutional checks. Shin [-@Shin2011-kc] traced these patterns to the enduring influence of Confucian governance ideals, in which the legitimacy of political authority derives from its capacity to provide for the welfare of the governed rather than from the procedural mechanisms through which leaders are selected.

The implication of this literature for the co-movement assumption is significant but has not been fully drawn out. If citizens in a post-developmental-state democracy evaluate their political system primarily in terms of output---what the system delivers---rather than process---how it delivers it---then satisfaction and normative commitment need not track one another. A citizen can be highly satisfied with democratic performance (because the economy is growing, the government is functioning, public services are adequate) without developing deeper commitment to democratic principles (because the commitment was never principled in the first place---it was always conditional on performance). Conversely, a citizen can become less committed to democracy in principle (because alternative governance models look attractive or because democratic procedures seem cumbersome) while remaining satisfied with current performance (because the system happens to be delivering). The co-movement assumption fails precisely when the normative and instrumental foundations of democratic support are decoupled---and the East Asian developmental state legacy creates conditions under which such decoupling is theoretically expected.

## Two pathways: performance-derived and identity-fused legitimation {#sec-theory-pathways}

This paper proposes that the relationship between economic performance and democratic attitudes is conditioned by the mode through which democratic legitimation was historically established. Two ideal-typical pathways are relevant to the East Asian cases under analysis.

*Performance-derived legitimation* characterizes cases in which democracy was adopted primarily as a means of achieving accountable governance and sustaining economic development, and in which democratic identity never became anchored to a source of normative commitment independent of output. In such cases, democratic satisfaction is expected to be strongly responsive to economic conditions, because economic performance is the criterion against which democracy is evaluated. Normative democratic commitment, by contrast, is expected to be weakly related to economic conditions, because no mechanism links material well-being to principled attachment to democratic procedures. The satisfaction and quality dimensions of democratic support run on separate tracks, and their trajectories may diverge over time as economic conditions shift without producing corresponding changes in normative orientation. South Korea, where the democratic transition of 1987 was driven by a broad coalition united more by opposition to military authoritarianism than by a shared democratic vision, and where the subsequent decades of democratic governance coincided with continued economic growth, exemplifies this pathway. Democracy proved itself by delivering; the delivery was real, but the normative foundation it built was shallow.

Framing this as "performance-derived" legitimation rather than simply "weak" or "incomplete" democratization is an important analytical distinction. The claim is not that Korean citizens fail to support democracy---they do, and at levels comparable to other consolidated democracies. The claim is that the *structure* of their support is instrumental rather than normative, meaning that the same levels of aggregate democratic endorsement may mask fundamentally different resilience profiles depending on whether that endorsement is principled or conditional.

*Identity-fused legitimation* characterizes cases in which democratic identity became intertwined with national identity through a specific historical configuration, anchoring normative commitment to democracy independently of economic performance. Taiwan is the paradigmatic case. Democratization in Taiwan was not merely a transition from authoritarian to democratic governance but a project of national self-definition: to be democratic was to be Taiwanese, and to be Taiwanese was to be not-China. The Democratic Progressive Party's political project, and the broader process of Taiwanization that accompanied and followed democratization, fused democratic governance with national identity in a way that gave normative democratic commitment an anchor independent of output evaluation. In such cases, the critical citizens pattern identified by Norris becomes possible: because normative commitment is secure, economic comfort frees citizens to become *more* demanding of democratic quality rather than more complacent. Material well-being raises the normative bar rather than lowering it.

The distinction between these pathways generates testable predictions about how economic evaluations should relate to different dimensions of democratic support in each case. Four hypotheses follow from the framework, along with a fifth that addresses the generality of the Korean pattern.

## Hypotheses {#sec-theory-hypotheses}

**H1** (Performance--satisfaction linkage): Economic evaluations are positively and significantly associated with democratic satisfaction in both Korea and Taiwan. This hypothesis reflects the expectation, common to both pathways, that citizens who evaluate the economy favorably will be more satisfied with the performance of their democratic system.

**H2** (Korean decoupling): In South Korea, economic evaluations have no significant relationship with democratic quality perceptions. This hypothesis reflects the performance-derived legitimation pathway, in which the instrumental and normative dimensions of democratic support run on separate tracks.

**H3** (Taiwanese critical citizens): In Taiwan, economic evaluations are negatively associated with democratic quality perceptions. This hypothesis reflects the identity-fused pathway, in which secure normative commitment allows economic comfort to fuel more demanding assessment of democratic quality.

**H4** (Cross-country divergence): The relationship between economic evaluations and democratic quality perceptions is significantly different between Korea and Taiwan. This hypothesis provides a formal test of whether the two legitimation pathways produce distinguishable empirical signatures.

**H5** (Universality of Korean decoupling): The Korean decoupling pattern holds across age groups, education levels, and model specifications. This hypothesis tests whether the performance-derived legitimation mode is a society-wide phenomenon rather than a feature of particular demographic subgroups, as would be expected if it reflects a structural property of the legitimation pathway rather than compositional variation in the electorate.


# Data and Methods {#sec-methods}

## Data {#sec-methods-data}

The analysis draws on the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS), a comparative survey program that has administered nationally representative face-to-face interviews across East and Southeast Asia since 2001 [@Asian-Barometer-Survey2023-qm]. The ABS is the principal source of longitudinal public opinion data on democratic attitudes in the region and has been the empirical foundation for much of the literature reviewed above. Six waves are currently available: Wave 1 (2001--2003), Wave 2 (2005--2008), Wave 3 (2010--2012), Wave 4 (2014--2016), Wave 5 (2018--2020), and Wave 6 (2021--2023). South Korea and Taiwan are among the few countries surveyed in all six waves, providing an unusually long panel of repeated cross-sections for comparative analysis.

The Korean sample comprises `r n_kr` respondents across the six waves (approximately 1,200 per wave), drawn from nationally representative probability samples of adults aged 18 and older. The Taiwanese sample comprises `r n_tw` respondents across the same six waves. Both countries use multi-stage stratified probability sampling with face-to-face interview administration. Survey weights are not applied in the main analysis, following the convention in the ABS comparative literature, but weighted estimates produce substantively identical results.

## Dependent variables {#sec-methods-dvs}

The analysis examines four individual dependent variables, each capturing a conceptually distinct dimension of democratic support. Following the reviewer-response literature on construct validity in democratic attitude measurement, the primary specifications treat each item separately rather than combining them into indices, since the items span different conceptual domains within Easton's [-@Easton1965-ap] framework. Summary indices are reported as supplementary analyses.

Two items capture the *satisfaction* dimension---citizens' evaluations of how well democracy is performing, corresponding to Easton's specific support:

- **Satisfaction with democracy** (primary): satisfaction with the way democracy works in the respondent's country. This is the main satisfaction outcome throughout the analysis.
- **Satisfaction with government** (secondary): satisfaction with the national government. Because government satisfaction is closely tied to incumbent performance evaluation and is conceptually proximate to economic evaluations, it is reported separately rather than averaged with democratic satisfaction.

Two items capture the *normative commitment* dimension---citizens' principled attachment to democracy as a form of government, corresponding to Easton's diffuse support:

- **Democratic preference**: agreement that democracy is always preferable to any other kind of government. This is the cleanest normative indicator available across all six waves and serves as the primary normative outcome.
- **Democratic extent**: the respondent's assessment of the extent to which their country is currently democratic. This item is evaluative rather than purely normative---it asks respondents to assess current democratic quality rather than express a principled preference---and is treated as a distinct perceived-quality outcome.

Two additional items are available from Wave 3 onward and are examined as supplementary regime legitimacy indicators: (3) agreement that the political system deserves support, and (4) disagreement that the system needs major change. These tap regime legitimacy and status quo acceptance rather than normative democratic commitment per se, and are reported in the robustness section rather than the main analysis.

All items are normalized to a 0--1 scale. The theoretical distinction between satisfaction and normative commitment is central to the paper's argument: the satisfaction paradox is the finding that economic evaluations are strongly associated with the former but not the latter.

## Independent variable: economic evaluations {#sec-methods-iv}

The key independent variable is an economic evaluation index constructed from six ABS items that capture both sociotropic and pocketbook assessments across current, retrospective, and prospective time horizons: (1) current national economic conditions, (2) current household economic conditions, (3) change in national economic conditions over the past year, (4) change in household economic conditions over the past year, (5) expected national economic conditions over the next year, and (6) expected household economic conditions over the next year. All six items are available across all waves with high coverage rates. Each is normalized to 0--1, and the index is computed as the mean of available items.

The inclusion of both sociotropic and pocketbook indicators is deliberate. A substantial literature in economic voting has documented that sociotropic evaluations (national economic conditions) tend to be stronger predictors of political attitudes than pocketbook evaluations (household conditions) in established democracies [@Lewis-Beck2000-do; @Duch2008-zu]. If the performance-derived legitimation argument is correct, both types of evaluation should predict satisfaction but not quality, since the argument concerns the structure of the performance-commitment relationship rather than the specific level at which economic evaluation operates. The robustness section tests each indicator individually.

## Controls {#sec-methods-controls}

All models include five control variables available across all six waves: age (normalized to 0--1), gender (binary), education level (normalized), urban-rural residence (binary), and political interest (normalized). These variables capture the major demographic and attitudinal correlates of democratic attitudes identified in the comparative literature. In robustness specifications, an institutional trust index---the mean of normalized trust in the national government, parliament, courts, and political parties---is added as an additional control to assess whether the economic-satisfaction relationship operates through or independently of institutional trust.

## Analytic strategy {#sec-methods-strategy}

The analysis proceeds in five steps designed to test H1 through H5 sequentially.

*Step 1: Descriptive trends.* Wave-level means for the satisfaction and quality clusters are plotted over time to document the divergence visually and estimate linear trend slopes via OLS on the wave means.

*Step 2: Wave-by-wave OLS regressions.* For each of the six waves in each country, two parallel models are estimated:

$\text{Satisfaction}_i = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{EconIndex}_i + \gamma \mathbf{X}_i + \varepsilon_i$

$\text{Quality}_i = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{EconIndex}_i + \gamma \mathbf{X}_i + \varepsilon_i$

where $\mathbf{X}_i$ is the vector of controls. The key comparison is between $\beta_1$ in the satisfaction and quality equations. H1 predicts $\beta_1 > 0$ in the satisfaction model for both countries. H2 predicts $\beta_1 \approx 0$ in the Korean quality model. H3 predicts $\beta_1 < 0$ in the Taiwanese quality model.

*Step 3: Pooled models with wave interaction.* To test whether the economic-satisfaction relationship strengthens over time (deepening performance dependence), data are pooled within each country and a centered wave interaction term is included.

*Step 4: Cross-country comparison.* To test H4, data from both countries are pooled and the following specification is estimated:

$Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{EconIndex}_i + \beta_2 \text{Korea}_i + \beta_3 (\text{EconIndex}_i \times \text{Korea}_i) + \delta \text{Wave}_i + \gamma \mathbf{X}_i + \varepsilon_i$

where $\beta_3$ captures the differential effect of economic evaluations in Korea relative to Taiwan. H4 predicts a significant $\beta_3$ in the quality equation, indicating that the decoupling pattern is significantly different across the two cases.

*Step 5: Mechanism probe---system pride and identity-fused legitimation in Taiwan.* If the identity-fusion explanation for Taiwan's critical citizens pattern is correct, the negative econ → quality relationship should be amplified among citizens who express pride specifically in their system of government, since system pride proxies for the strength of the democratic identity anchor that makes critical evaluation possible. The ABS includes an item asking respondents whether they are proud of their system of government (available Waves 3--6), which is conceptually distinct from generic national pride: the former captures identification with the political system as such, while the latter encompasses cultural, economic, and historical sources of national attachment that need not relate to democratic governance. Using the system pride item, respondents in both countries are split into high- and low-pride groups, and the core democratic preference model is estimated separately for each. Additionally, the continuous interaction between economic evaluations and system pride is tested. The key prediction is an asymmetric interaction: system pride should amplify critical evaluation in Taiwan (where democratic and national identity are fused, making pride in the system tantamount to pride in the democratic project) but not in Korea (where system pride may reflect satisfaction with governance output rather than normative democratic identification). Generic national pride and an index of authoritarian nostalgia (endorsement of strongman, military, expert, and single-party rule) are tested as alternative moderators in the appendix. This test moves the identity-fusion argument from narrative to individual-level empirical evidence.

*Step 6: Robustness and sensitivity.* The core finding is tested against multiple alternative specifications: (a) summary indices alongside the individual-item primary analysis, (b) inclusion of institutional trust as an additional control, (c) individual economic indicators rather than the composite index, (d) subgroup analyses by age, education, and political interest (H5), (e) ordered logit models on the original ordinal response scales as an alternative to OLS on normalized outcomes, (f) within-wave standardized outcomes to address measurement comparability across waves, and (g) a winner/loser analysis testing whether the Korean decoupling is an artifact of electoral position rather than a structural feature of democratic support. An appendix documents item wording and response scales across all waves and both countries.


# Results {#sec-results}

## Descriptive trends: the satisfaction paradox {#sec-results-descriptive}

The central empirical claim of this paper is that democratic satisfaction and democratic quality perception have diverged in South Korea over the two decades spanned by the Asian Barometer Survey. @fig-dissociation presents the core evidence. Between 2011 and 2022---the period for which both cluster indices can be fully computed---the satisfaction cluster rose from 0.456 to 0.525 on the normalized scale, an increase of approximately seven percentage points. Over the same period, the democratic quality cluster drifted from 0.366 to 0.351, a modest decline of one and a half points. OLS trend slopes confirm the divergence: satisfaction with democracy increased at +`r .slope("Satisfaction")` normalized units per decade, while preference for democracy as the best form of government declined at --`r abs(.slope("Democratic quality"))` per decade. System support declined at --0.045 per decade. These magnitudes are not dramatic in isolation, but their theoretical significance lies in the direction of movement rather than its scale. Consolidation theory predicts co-movement; the Korean data show the opposite.

The divergence is clearer when individual components are examined. Within the satisfaction cluster, satisfaction with the national government exhibited the most pronounced trajectory, climbing from approximately 0.33 in 2011 to 0.53 by 2022---a twenty percentage-point increase concentrated primarily in the 2011--2015 interval, likely reflecting the transition from the late Lee Myung-bak administration to the early Park Geun-hye period. Satisfaction with democracy followed a more gradual upward path. Within the democratic quality cluster, the steepest decline appeared in the proportion of respondents affirming that democracy is always preferable to other forms of government. The finding that the political system does not need major change, by contrast, trended mildly upward (+0.047 per decade), suggesting that Korean citizens have become simultaneously less committed to democracy in principle and more accepting of the status quo in practice---a combination that is precisely what the performance-derived legitimation framework would predict.

Taiwan presents a strikingly different picture (@fig-dissociation, right panel). Rather than diverging, satisfaction and quality perceptions track each other more closely across the observation period, and both remain at comparatively high levels. Where Korea shows satisfaction rising while normative commitment declines, Taiwan shows no such dissociation: the two dimensions of democratic support move broadly in parallel, consistent with the identity-fused legitimation pathway in which performance evaluation and normative commitment are anchored to the same underlying source. The three-cluster comparison (@fig-econ-comovement) reinforces this contrast. In Korea, economic evaluations co-move with satisfaction while quality perceptions drift independently; in Taiwan, all three clusters show greater co-movement, reflecting the tighter integration of performance evaluation and normative assessment that the theoretical framework predicts under identity-fused legitimation.

The output legitimacy argument requires that economic evaluations track satisfaction more closely than they track quality perception, and the descriptive evidence is consistent with this expectation. In Korea, the economic evaluation cluster tracks the satisfaction trend reasonably well while diverging from quality perceptions. The economic evaluation cluster declined modestly from 0.439 in 2011 to 0.409 in 2022, primarily driven by declining household income satisfaction (--0.162 per decade) and deteriorating national economic outlook (--0.092 per decade). That satisfaction continued to rise even as economic evaluations themselves declined suggests that the relationship between economic conditions and democratic satisfaction operates at the individual level rather than through aggregate co-movement---a possibility the regression models explore directly. In Taiwan, the tighter co-movement of all three clusters at the aggregate level is consistent with a legitimation structure in which performance evaluation and normative assessment are not decoupled.


## The mechanism: economic evaluations and the structure of democratic support {#sec-results-mechanism}

The core analytic test estimates parallel OLS regressions for each ABS wave, predicting each of the four individual dependent variables from the economic evaluation index with controls for age, gender, education, urban-rural residence, and political interest. If performance-derived legitimation characterizes Korean democratic support, economic evaluations should strongly predict satisfaction but not normative democratic preference. The disaggregated results reveal a more nuanced and theoretically informative pattern than summary indices alone would suggest.

*Satisfaction with democracy.* Across all six waves, economic evaluations are a consistent and significant predictor of satisfaction with democracy. The coefficient ranges from $\beta$ = `r .wi_b("Korea", "sat_democracy_n", 2)` in Wave 2 (2006) to $\beta$ = `r .wi_b("Korea", "sat_democracy_n", 4)` in Wave 4 (2015), with all estimates significant at *p* < 0.001. The pooled estimate with wave fixed effects is $\beta$ = `r .b(idvs, "sat_democracy_n")` (*p* < 0.001, R$^2$ = `r round(.b(idvs, "sat_democracy_n", "r_sq"), 3)`). Satisfaction with government shows an even stronger relationship ($\beta$ = `r .wi_range("Korea", "sat_govt_n")` across waves; pooled $\beta$ = `r .b(idvs, "sat_govt_n")`), consistent with the expectation that government satisfaction is more directly output-driven. These results confirm H1: economic evaluations are strongly associated with the satisfaction dimension of democratic support in Korea.

*Democracy always preferable.* This is the cleanest test of H2, because the item captures principled normative commitment rather than performance evaluation. The results are striking in their clarity. From Wave 2 (2006) onward, economic evaluations have no statistically significant relationship with democratic preference. The wave-by-wave coefficients are $\beta$ = `r .wi_b("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 2)` (*p* `r .wi_p("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 2)`) in 2006, `r .wi_b("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 3)` (*p* `r .wi_p("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 3)`) in 2011, `r .wi_b("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 4)` (*p* `r .wi_p("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 4)`) in 2015, `r .wi_b("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 5)` (*p* `r .wi_p("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 5)`) in 2019, and `r .wi_b("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 6)` (*p* `r .wi_p("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 6)`) in 2022. The pooled estimate is $\beta$ = `r .b(idvs, "qual_pref_dem_n")` (*p* `r .p_str(idvs[idvs$dv=="qual_pref_dem_n","p.value"])`). Economic evaluations and standard demographic controls explain virtually none of the variation in whether Korean citizens believe democracy is always preferable. Whatever determines normative democratic commitment in South Korea, it is not economic performance.

The Wave 1 (2003) result is an instructive exception: economic evaluations show a significant *negative* association with democratic preference ($\beta$ = `r .wi_b("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 1)`, *p* `r .wi_p("Korea", "qual_pref_dem_n", 1)`), plausibly reflecting the aftermath of the 1997--1998 Asian financial crisis, during which economically comfortable citizens may have developed a more critical stance toward the democratic governance that presided over the crisis. This relationship dissipated by Wave 2 and does not reappear.

*Democratic extent and regime legitimacy items.* The disaggregation reveals an important finding that summary indices obscured. Perceived democratic extent---how democratic respondents judge their country to be---shows a significant *negative* relationship with economic evaluations from Wave 2 onward ($\beta$ = `r { vals <- wi |> filter(country=="Korea", dv=="qual_extent_n", wave>=2) |> pull(estimate); paste0(round(min(vals),3), " to ", round(max(vals),3)) }`, all *p* < 0.001; pooled $\beta$ = `r .b(idvs, "qual_extent_n")`, *p* < 0.001). Economically comfortable Koreans rate their country as *less* democratic. The supplementary regime legitimacy items available from Wave 3 onward show even stronger negative effects: system support ($\beta$ = `r .b(idvs, "qual_sys_support_n")`, *p* < 0.001) and no major change ($\beta$ = `r .b(idvs, "qual_sys_change_n")`, *p* < 0.001).

This pattern demands careful interpretation. The democratic extent and regime legitimacy items are evaluative rather than normative---they ask respondents to assess the current system's quality rather than to express a principled preference for democracy. The negative coefficients indicate that economically comfortable Koreans are more *critical* of their system's democratic quality and less convinced it deserves support, even as they are more *satisfied* with its performance. This is a form of critical evaluation, but it is decoupled from the normative dimension: Korean citizens can simultaneously be satisfied with democratic performance, critical of democratic quality, and indifferent to democracy as a principled preference. The performance-derived legitimation framework accommodates this configuration: when democratic support is instrumental, satisfaction and critical evaluation can coexist because neither is anchored to a normative commitment that would give them coherent direction.

## Taiwan: the critical citizens pattern {#sec-results-taiwan}

The parallel analysis for Taiwan reveals a fundamentally different configuration. As in Korea, economic evaluations are strong and consistent predictors of democratic satisfaction across all six waves ($\beta$ = `r .wi_range("Taiwan", "sat_democracy_n")` for satisfaction with democracy; $\beta$ = `r .wi_range("Taiwan", "sat_govt_n")` for government satisfaction, all *p* < 0.001). The satisfaction side of the equation is common to both cases.

The critical divergence appears in normative democratic preference. In Taiwan, economic evaluations are significantly and *negatively* associated with the belief that democracy is always preferable in four of six waves: $\beta$ = `r .wi_b("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 1)` (*p* `r .wi_p("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 1)`) in 2001, `r .wi_b("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 2)` (*p* `r .wi_p("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 2)`) in 2006, `r .wi_b("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 4)` (*p* `r .wi_p("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 4)`) in 2014, `r .wi_b("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 5)` (*p* `r .wi_p("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 5)`) in 2019, and `r .wi_b("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 6)` (*p* `r .wi_p("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 6)`) in 2022. The pooled estimate is $\beta$ = `r .pi_b("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n")` (*p* `r .pi_p("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n")`). The single exception is Wave 3 (2010), where the estimate is `r .wi_b("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n", 3)` and nonsignificant. The pattern is not merely different from the Korean null---it is substantively large and, in Wave 6, remarkably strong. Economically comfortable Taiwanese citizens are substantially *more* committed to democracy as a matter of principle.

The democratic extent item shows a parallel but weaker pattern in Taiwan: pooled $\beta$ = `r .pi_b("Taiwan", "qual_extent_n")` (*p* `r .pi_p("Taiwan", "qual_extent_n")`). But here a critical comparative nuance emerges. Korea also shows significant negative effects on democratic extent ($\beta$ = `r .b(idvs, "qual_extent_n")`, *p* < 0.001), meaning economically comfortable citizens in *both* countries rate their country's democratic quality lower. The Korea-Taiwan divergence is concentrated in the *normative* item---democracy always preferable---where Korea shows no relationship ($\beta$ = `r .b(idvs, "qual_pref_dem_n")`, ns) and Taiwan shows a strong negative one ($\beta$ = `r .pi_b("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n")`***). This distinction validates the decision to disaggregate dependent variables: the two normative-cluster items behave very differently, and only the purest normative measure captures the theoretically decisive cross-country contrast.

The ordered logit specification confirms these findings on the original ordinal scales. For democracy always preferable, the ordered logit coefficient is $\beta$ = `r .olog_b("Korea")` (*p* `r .olog_p("Korea")`) in Korea and $\beta$ = `r .olog_b("Taiwan")` (*p* `r .olog_p("Taiwan")`) in Taiwan---a null-versus-large contrast that mirrors the OLS results.

## Cross-country comparison {#sec-results-crosscountry}

The formal test of whether the Korea-Taiwan difference is statistically significant pools both countries and estimates the interaction between economic evaluations and a Korea indicator variable, controlling for wave fixed effects and the standard covariate set.

For the theoretically decisive dependent variable---democracy always preferable---the Taiwan baseline shows a substantial negative relationship ($\beta$ = `r .xci_b("qual_pref_dem_n", "econ_index")`, *p* `r .xci_p("qual_pref_dem_n", "econ_index")`). The Korea interaction term is positive and highly significant ($\beta$ = `r .xci_b("qual_pref_dem_n", "econ_index:is_korea")`, *p* `r .xci_p("qual_pref_dem_n", "econ_index:is_korea")`), indicating that the economic-preference relationship is significantly weaker (closer to zero) in Korea. The implied Korean coefficient (`r round(.xci_b("qual_pref_dem_n", "econ_index") + .xci_b("qual_pref_dem_n", "econ_index:is_korea"), 3)`) is essentially zero, confirming the decoupling documented in the wave-by-wave analysis. This result directly supports H4.

For satisfaction with democracy, the interaction is also significant ($\beta$ = `r .xci_b("sat_democracy_n", "econ_index:is_korea")`, *p* `r .xci_p("sat_democracy_n", "econ_index:is_korea")`), indicating a somewhat weaker economic-satisfaction linkage in Korea (implied $\beta$ = `r round(.xci_b("sat_democracy_n", "econ_index") + .xci_b("sat_democracy_n", "econ_index:is_korea"), 3)`) than Taiwan (baseline $\beta$ = `r .xci_b("sat_democracy_n", "econ_index")`)---but both are large and highly significant, consistent with H1.

For democratic extent, the interaction is positive and significant ($\beta$ = `r .xci_b("qual_extent_n", "econ_index:is_korea")`, *p* `r .xci_p("qual_extent_n", "econ_index:is_korea")`), confirming that the negative economic-extent relationship is weaker in Korea (implied $\beta$ = `r round(.xci_b("qual_extent_n", "econ_index") + .xci_b("qual_extent_n", "econ_index:is_korea"), 3)`) than Taiwan (baseline $\beta$ = `r .xci_b("qual_extent_n", "econ_index")`). Both countries show critical evaluation on this item, but Taiwan's is stronger.

## Robustness {#sec-results-robustness}

The core finding---that economic evaluations are strongly associated with satisfaction but unrelated to normative democratic preference in Korea, while predicting both in Taiwan---is subjected to several alternative specifications.

*Summary indices.* When satisfaction and quality items are combined into mean indices (as in much of the existing ABS literature), the results are consistent with the individual-item analysis. The Korean satisfaction index shows a strong economic relationship ($\beta$ = `r round(min(kr_sat$estimate),3)` to `r round(max(kr_sat$estimate),3)` across waves), while the quality index hovers near zero from Wave 2 onward. The Taiwanese quality index is significantly negative in five of six waves ($\beta$ = `r round(max(tw_qua$estimate[tw_qua$p.value<0.05]),3)` to `r round(min(tw_qua$estimate[tw_qua$p.value<0.05]),3)`). The indices mask the important distinction between democratic preference and democratic extent documented in the primary analysis, but they do not contradict it.

*Institutional trust as a control.* Adding an institutional trust index to the baseline model reduces the economic-satisfaction coefficient but leaves it highly significant. Trust independently predicts satisfaction and accounts for additional variance. The economic channel thus operates partly through and partly independently of institutional trust. In the democratic preference equation, adding trust changes neither the magnitude nor the significance of the economic coefficient.

*Individual economic indicators.* Each of the six economic evaluation components is entered individually. All six significantly predict satisfaction in Korea. The decoupling pattern is clearest for current evaluations (national and household economic conditions), which show strong satisfaction effects and no democratic preference effects. Forward-looking indicators (economic outlooks) show small negative democratic extent effects, suggesting that economic optimism is weakly associated with more demanding quality assessments---a faint echo of the Taiwanese critical citizens pattern that does not alter the overall picture.

*Within-wave standardization and ordered logit.* To address potential measurement comparability concerns across waves, within-wave z-scored outcomes produce the same pattern of results. Ordered logit models on the original ordinal response scales confirm the OLS findings: the ordered logit coefficient for democracy always preferable is $\beta$ = `r .olog_b("Korea")` (*p* `r .olog_p("Korea")`) in Korea and $\beta$ = `r .olog_b("Taiwan")` (*p* `r .olog_p("Taiwan")`) in Taiwan.

*Alternative normative commitment measures.* A potential concern is that the core finding rests on a single normative indicator---the "democracy is always preferable" item. To assess whether the decoupling pattern reflects a genuine structural property of Korean democratic attitudes or an artifact of one question's phrasing, four alternative normative-adjacent measures available in the ABS are tested as dependent variables: (1) "democracy is the best form of government" (Waves 3--6, 4-point scale), (2) democracy versus economic development as a forced-choice tradeoff (Waves 1--6), (3) "democracy is suitable for our country" (Waves 1--6, 10-point scale), and (4) whether democracy is capable of solving society's problems (Waves 1--6, binary). All four items capture pro-democratic attitudes, but none demands the unconditional commitment that "democracy is always preferable" requires.

The results sharpen rather than undermine the paper's argument. All four alternative measures show significant *positive* associations with economic evaluations in both countries: economically comfortable citizens in Korea and Taiwan alike are more likely to endorse democracy as the best form, as suitable, as efficacious, and as preferable to economic development (see Appendix H). The Korea--Taiwan divergence is concentrated exclusively in the unconditional normative commitment item. This specificity is theoretically informative. The four alternative measures tap what might be called conditional democratic endorsement---assessments of democracy's comparative merits, practical suitability, or problem-solving capacity that naturally co-move with economic comfort in any country where democracy is functioning adequately. The "always preferable" item, by contrast, demands principled commitment that transcends situational evaluation, corresponding most closely to Easton's [-@Easton1965-ap] concept of diffuse support. That Korean citizens endorse democracy on every conditional measure while decoupling on the sole unconditional one is precisely the pattern the performance-derived legitimation framework predicts: instrumental evaluation produces positive assessments of democracy as a working system, but does not generate the principled attachment that would survive a counterfactual in which the system stopped working. The finding is not fragile---it is specific to the theoretical construct the paper is designed to measure.

*Subgroup heterogeneity.* The decoupling of economic evaluations from democratic preference is not confined to particular demographic segments (H5). The economic-satisfaction coefficient is virtually identical for younger and older respondents and similar across education levels. In no subgroup does the economic-preference relationship reach significance in the positive direction; the decoupling is society-wide.

The most analytically informative subgroup finding concerns political interest. Among politically interested Korean citizens, economic evaluations show a negative association with democratic preference ($\beta$ = `r .poli_b("Korea", "High interest", "qual_pref_dem_n")`, *p* `r .poli_p("Korea", "High interest", "qual_pref_dem_n")`)---approaching but not reaching conventional significance, and partially mirroring the Taiwanese critical citizens pattern. Among citizens with low political interest, the coefficient is essentially zero ($\beta$ = `r .poli_b("Korea", "Low interest", "qual_pref_dem_n")`, *p* `r .poli_p("Korea", "Low interest", "qual_pref_dem_n")`). This result suggests that the capacity for normatively grounded, performance-critical democratic evaluation exists within the Korean public but is confined to the politically attentive minority. The disengaged majority---which drives the aggregate decoupling pattern---evaluates democracy in purely instrumental terms. The challenge for Korean democratic deepening is not the absence of critical citizenship but its confinement to a narrow stratum.

## Electoral winners, losers, and the structure of democratic support {#sec-results-winnerloser}

A potential concern with the Korean decoupling finding is that it reflects compositional rather than structural dynamics. If citizens who supported the losing party in the most recent election are disproportionately disenchanted with democracy---not because of the performance-derived legitimation mode but because their side lost---the aggregate null relationship between economic evaluations and normative commitment could be an artifact of partisan disappointment rather than a genuine structural property of Korean democratic attitudes. The ABS includes an item identifying whether the respondent voted for the winning or losing party in the most recent national election (Waves 2--6), permitting a direct test.

The results decisively rule out the sore-loser interpretation. In Korea, the economic-preference relationship is null for both electoral winners ($\beta$ = --0.052, ns) and losers ($\beta$ = 0.031, ns). The formal interaction between economic evaluations and winner status is nonsignificant ($\beta$ = --0.025, *p* = 0.75). Korean citizens decouple economic evaluations from normative democratic commitment regardless of whether their party holds power---precisely the pattern the performance-derived legitimation framework predicts, and precisely what an electoral-grievance account does not. The decoupling is structural.

In Taiwan, the critical citizens pattern appears in both groups but is significantly stronger among winners ($\beta$ = --0.246, *p* < 0.001) than losers ($\beta$ = --0.128, *p* < 0.05). The interaction is significant ($\beta$ = --0.190, *p* = 0.010), indicating that the winner/loser gap on normative commitment exists in Taiwan but not in Korea. This asymmetry is itself theoretically informative. Under identity-fused legitimation, citizens whose party won the election are more invested in the democratic project and therefore more normatively demanding when economic conditions are favorable---a pattern consistent with the critical citizens logic and inconsistent with a sore-loser account, in which losers rather than winners should drive critical evaluation.

On the satisfaction dimension, by contrast, the winner/loser distinction makes no difference in either country. Economic evaluations predict satisfaction with democracy equally for winners (Korea $\beta$ = 0.349, Taiwan $\beta$ = 0.311, both *p* < 0.001) and losers (Korea $\beta$ = 0.364, Taiwan $\beta$ = 0.406, both *p* < 0.001). The performance track operates identically regardless of electoral position---as expected if satisfaction is driven by economic outcomes rather than partisan sentiment.

The combined pattern constitutes a signature test that distinguishes the two legitimation logics at the individual level. Performance-derived legitimation (Korea) decouples economic evaluations from normative commitment for everyone, winners and losers alike, because the disconnection reflects the structure of democratic support rather than the fortunes of any particular electoral coalition. Identity-fused legitimation (Taiwan) produces critical citizens among everyone, but *especially* among winners, because the democratic identity that anchors normative commitment is most salient for those whose party holds responsibility for the democratic project. The satisfaction dimension, which operates through the performance channel in both countries, is unaffected by electoral position in either case.


## Mechanism probe: system pride and the identity-fusion pathway {#sec-results-pride}

The theoretical framework attributes Taiwan's critical citizens pattern to the fusion of democratic and national identity. If this mechanism is correct, the negative econ → quality relationship should be amplified among citizens who identify with their political system, since such identification proxies for the strength of the democratic identity anchor that enables normatively grounded critical evaluation.

A first test using the ABS generic national pride item ("How proud are you to be a citizen of your country?", Waves 2--6) yields null results in both countries. The formal interaction between economic evaluations and national pride is nonsignificant in the Taiwanese democratic preference equation ($\beta$ = `r .np_int_b("Taiwan")`, *p* `r .np_int_p("Taiwan")`) and in the Korean equation ($\beta$ = `r .np_int_b("Korea")`, *p* `r .np_int_p("Korea")`). National pride is too diffuse a sentiment to capture the specific democratic-national identity configuration the theory posits; it encompasses cultural, economic, and historical sources of attachment that are orthogonal to pride in democratic governance as such.

A more theoretically precise test uses the ABS system pride item ("I am proud of our system of government," Waves 3--6; Taiwan *n* = 5,688; Korea *n* = 4,812). This item directly taps identification with the political system rather than national identity broadly construed. In Taiwan, where democratization was constitutive of national self-definition, system pride should capture precisely the democratic identity anchor that the theory identifies; in Korea, where national pride is tied to economic achievement and cultural prestige, system pride need not carry the same democratic-normative content.

The system pride interaction produces significant moderation in Taiwan. For the theoretically decisive dependent variable---democracy always preferable---the interaction between economic evaluations and system pride is $\beta$ = `r .sp_int_b("Taiwan", "Democracy always preferable", "econ_index:sys_proud_n")` (*p* `r .sp_int_p("Taiwan", "Democracy always preferable", "econ_index:sys_proud_n")`), indicating that the negative econ → democratic preference relationship is substantially stronger among citizens with high system pride. The main effect of economic evaluations conditional on low system pride is near zero ($\beta$ = `r .sp_int_b("Taiwan", "Democracy always preferable", "econ_index")`, ns), while the combined effect at high system pride is large and negative. For the quality index, the interaction is also significant ($\beta$ = `r .sp_int_b("Taiwan", "Quality index", "econ_index:sys_proud_n")`, *p* `r .sp_int_p("Taiwan", "Quality index", "econ_index:sys_proud_n")`), though weaker, reflecting the diluting influence of the democratic extent component, which shows no significant system pride moderation ($\beta$ = `r .sp_int_b("Taiwan", "Extent democratic", "econ_index:sys_proud_n")`, ns). The pattern is theoretically coherent: system pride amplifies critical *normative* evaluation of democracy but not critical *descriptive* assessment of current democratic extent, consistent with the distinction between principled commitment and situational evaluation that runs throughout the analysis.

The median-split results reinforce this finding. Among high-system-pride Taiwanese, the econ → democratic preference coefficient is $\beta$ = `r .sp_sub_b("Taiwan", "High system pride", "Democracy always preferable")` (*p* `r .sp_sub_p("Taiwan", "High system pride", "Democracy always preferable")`); among low-system-pride Taiwanese, $\beta$ = `r .sp_sub_b("Taiwan", "Low system pride", "Democracy always preferable")` (*p* `r .sp_sub_p("Taiwan", "Low system pride", "Democracy always preferable")`). Both groups exhibit the critical citizens pattern---consistent with the society-wide character of identity-fused legitimation---but the pattern is roughly 70 percent stronger among those who explicitly identify with the political system.

In Korea, the system pride interaction is nonsignificant for democratic preference ($\beta$ near zero, *p* > 0.80), and the decoupling holds across pride levels. Korean citizens who express pride in their system of government are no more likely to convert economic comfort into normative democratic commitment than those who do not. This asymmetry---significant moderation in Taiwan, null in Korea---is consistent with the argument that system pride carries different content in the two countries: in Taiwan, it indexes democratic identification; in Korea, it indexes satisfaction with governance performance, which is already captured by the economic evaluation variable.

An alternative moderator---an index of authoritarian nostalgia constructed from endorsement of strongman, military, expert, and single-party rule---shows no significant interaction with economic evaluations in either country. In a direct comparison of all three candidate moderators on the same restricted sample, only system pride produces a significant interaction in Taiwan ($\beta$ = `r .sp_comp_b("Taiwan", "System pride")`, *p* `r .sp_comp_p("Taiwan", "System pride")`); authoritarian nostalgia ($\beta$ = --0.086, ns) and generic national pride ($\beta$ = `r .sp_comp_b("Taiwan", "National pride")`, ns) do not. The identity-fusion mechanism, as captured by system pride, is the only individual-level moderator that discriminates between the two legitimation pathways.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

The results provide consistent and robust evidence for the satisfaction paradox in South Korea: democratic satisfaction is strongly driven by economic evaluations while normative democratic commitment is essentially independent of them. This section interprets these findings through the performance-derived legitimation framework, develops the comparative implications of the Taiwan contrast, addresses the significance of the political interest subgroup finding, and considers what the pattern implies for democratic resilience in light of the December 2024 martial law crisis.

## Performance-derived legitimation as a distinct mode {#sec-discussion-performance}

The core finding---that economic evaluations robustly predict satisfaction but not quality across two decades of survey data---is precisely what the performance-derived legitimation pathway predicts and what alternatives do not. A generalized political cynicism account would predict declining scores on *both* satisfaction and quality, as disaffected citizens withdraw from democratic evaluation altogether. A post-materialist critical citizens account, in the Norris [-@Norris1999-sn] mold, would predict rising quality perceptions alongside declining satisfaction, as materially secure citizens hold democracy to higher standards. Neither pattern appears in the Korean data. Instead, satisfaction rises while quality declines---a configuration that only the instrumental evaluation framework can parsimoniously account for.

The performance-derived legitimation concept advances the analytical vocabulary beyond the existing alternatives in the East Asian democratization literature. Park and Shin's [-@Park2006-bv] influential characterization of Korean democracy as "incomplete" implies a teleological trajectory in which democratic support should eventually mature into deeper normative commitment. The evidence assembled here suggests that this maturation has not occurred over two decades and, more importantly, that the structure of Korean democratic support gives no reason to expect it will. The issue is not that Korean democratization is *unfinished* but that it rests on a foundation---performance evaluation---that does not generate normative commitment as a byproduct. Satisfaction and commitment are not stages on a single developmental path; they are products of different causal processes.

The Eastonian framework, while foundational, does not fully anticipate this configuration. Easton [-@Easton1965-ap] expected that sustained specific support would gradually deposit into a reservoir of diffuse support---that citizens who experienced good governance over time would develop generalized attachment to the system that produced it. The Korean data suggest that this conversion mechanism is not automatic. Specific support can accumulate without generating diffuse support if the evaluative framework remains instrumental throughout. The reservoir metaphor implies a one-way flow from performance evaluation to principled attachment; the Korean case suggests the flow can be blocked entirely.

## Taiwan's divergent pathway {#sec-discussion-taiwan}

The Taiwanese findings are theoretically important not only as a comparative foil but in their own right. The consistent negative relationship between economic evaluations and normative democratic preference ($\beta$ = `r { vals <- wi |> filter(country=="Taiwan", dv=="qual_pref_dem_n", p.value<0.05) |> pull(estimate); paste0(round(max(vals),2), " to ", round(min(vals),2)) }` across four of six waves, pooled $\beta$ = `r .pi_b("Taiwan", "qual_pref_dem_n")`) is among the strongest empirical demonstrations of the critical citizens dynamic in an East Asian context. Previous work using ABS data has noted comparatively high levels of democratic support in Taiwan [@Chu2008-fk; @Chu2020-ir] but has not, to my knowledge, documented the *mechanism* through which economic conditions relate to normative evaluation at the individual level with this degree of specificity.

The identity-fusion explanation for the Taiwanese pattern has important scope conditions. The argument is not that national identity generically anchors democratic commitment---if it did, the pattern would appear in any country with strong nationalist sentiment---but that the *specific historical configuration* through which democratic identity and national identity became coterminous in Taiwan created conditions uniquely favorable to the critical citizens dynamic. Democratization in Taiwan was simultaneously a project of national differentiation from China, and the sustained cross-strait tension that has characterized the post-democratization period continuously reinforces this fusion. The DPP's political project made being democratic constitutive of being Taiwanese in a way that has no precise analogue in the Korean case, where democratization was experienced primarily as a domestic political transition rather than a project of national self-definition.

The mechanism probe reported in @sec-results-pride provides individual-level evidence for this interpretation. While generic national pride does not moderate the economic-preference relationship in either country, a more theoretically targeted measure---pride in the system of government---significantly amplifies the critical citizens pattern in Taiwan but not in Korea. Among high-system-pride Taiwanese, the negative econ → democratic preference relationship is roughly 70 percent stronger than among low-system-pride Taiwanese ($\beta$ = `r .sp_sub_b("Taiwan", "High system pride", "Democracy always preferable")` versus `r .sp_sub_b("Taiwan", "Low system pride", "Democracy always preferable")`). The interaction is significant at the individual level ($\beta$ = `r .sp_int_b("Taiwan", "Democracy always preferable", "econ_index:sys_proud_n")`, *p* `r .sp_int_p("Taiwan", "Democracy always preferable", "econ_index:sys_proud_n")`), and system pride is the only candidate moderator that produces this asymmetry; neither authoritarian nostalgia nor generic national pride discriminates between the two countries' patterns. System pride, because it captures identification with the political system as such, is a more precise proxy for the democratic-national identity fusion that the theoretical framework posits. Citizens who are proud of their system of government in a context where that system is constitutively democratic exhibit the strongest critical evaluation when economic conditions are favorable---precisely the dynamic the identity-fusion pathway predicts. That the same variable carries no moderating power in Korea, where system pride plausibly indexes satisfaction with governance output rather than democratic identification, further validates the cross-country distinction. A still sharper test would use direct measures of Taiwanese versus Chinese identity, which the ABS does not include consistently across all waves but which future research should pursue.

## The political interest finding {#sec-discussion-polinterest}

The most analytically interesting subgroup result concerns political interest. Among politically engaged Korean citizens, the economic-preference relationship is negative ($\beta$ = `r .poli_b("Korea", "High interest", "qual_pref_dem_n")`, *p* `r .poli_p("Korea", "High interest", "qual_pref_dem_n")`)---approaching but not reaching conventional significance, and directionally consistent with the Taiwanese critical citizens pattern. Among disengaged citizens, the coefficient is essentially zero ($\beta$ = `r .poli_b("Korea", "Low interest", "qual_pref_dem_n")`, *p* `r .poli_p("Korea", "Low interest", "qual_pref_dem_n")`). The aggregate Korean pattern is driven by the disengaged majority.

This finding has two implications. First, it suggests that the *direction* of normatively grounded, performance-critical democratic evaluation exists within the Korean public but is confined to a politically attentive minority and is weak even there. The structural conditions for critical citizenship---material comfort combined with normative engagement---exist in Korea, but they produce only a faint echo of the Taiwanese pattern among the most politically engaged citizens. Second, the performance-derived legitimation mode is not a fixed cultural property but a distributional phenomenon: it characterizes the median Korean citizen rather than every Korean citizen. The challenge for democratic deepening in Korea is not creating the critical citizens dynamic from scratch but strengthening and expanding what remains a marginal tendency.

This reading also helps explain why Korean democratic institutions have functioned effectively despite shallow normative foundations. The politically engaged minority---the same citizens who exhibit critical democratic evaluation---are disproportionately likely to participate in the institutional processes (voting, protest, civic engagement) that constitute democratic accountability. The martial law crisis of December 2024 was resolved not by a mass normative uprising but by the rapid institutional response of legislators, judges, and an organized opposition---precisely the actors drawn from the politically engaged stratum. Democratic resilience, on this reading, may require only that the engaged minority be sufficiently large and institutionally embedded to activate the system's defenses, even if the broader public's commitment is instrumental rather than principled.

## The Yoon crisis and democratic resilience {#sec-discussion-yoon}

The paper's data end in 2022; it does not claim to explain the Yoon crisis causally. But the December 2024 martial law episode provides a natural, if informal, illustration of the vulnerability that the paper's framework identifies. The institutional response was swift and effective: martial law overturned within six hours, impeachment proceedings initiated immediately, conviction and life sentence delivered within fourteen months. By any institutional metric, South Korean democracy passed the test.

But the theory developed here suggests that institutional resilience and normative resilience are distinct properties that need not coincide. The question is not whether the system held---it did---but *why* it held. If the answer is that institutional safeguards functioned as designed (legislative override provisions, judicial independence, military restraint), then the system's resilience reflects institutional engineering rather than mass democratic commitment. The ABS data, showing rising satisfaction alongside declining normative commitment in the years preceding the crisis, are consistent with this interpretation. The system held not because citizens were deeply committed to democratic governance as a matter of principle but because the institutional machinery was robust enough to contain an authoritarian challenge without requiring mass normative mobilization.

This interpretation carries a cautionary implication. Institutional resilience that does not rest on normative foundations is brittle in ways that may not be apparent until the institutional safeguards themselves are compromised. The 2024 crisis was an amateurish attempt by an isolated president with single-digit approval ratings; the institutional response was correspondingly straightforward. A more competent authoritarian challenge---one that gradually eroded institutional checks rather than frontally assaulting them, or one that enjoyed genuine popular support---would face a public whose democratic commitment is, on the evidence presented here, conditional on continued performance rather than principled in character. The satisfaction paradox, in this reading, describes a democracy that is resilient to institutional shocks but vulnerable to the slower, subtler process of legitimacy erosion that Levitsky and Ziblatt [-@Levitsky2018-dd] describe as the characteristic mode of contemporary democratic backsliding.

## Limitations {#sec-discussion-limitations}

Several limitations merit acknowledgment. First, the ABS provides repeated cross-sections rather than panel data, which means the analysis documents between-person associations at each wave rather than within-person change over time. The claim that economic evaluations are causally prior to satisfaction and quality perceptions rests on theoretical reasoning and the consistency of the pattern across waves rather than on a formal causal identification strategy such as instrumental variables or panel fixed effects. Reverse causality---the possibility that satisfaction shapes economic evaluations rather than the reverse---cannot be ruled out with cross-sectional data, though the asymmetric pattern (strong association with satisfaction, no association with normative commitment) is difficult to reconcile with a pure reverse-causality account. Panel data, which would allow tracking the same individuals across waves, would substantially strengthen the causal interpretation.

Second, the normative commitment indicators---particularly democratic preference and democratic extent---capture different conceptual dimensions (principled preference versus perceived quality), as the Methods section discusses. The primary specifications treat them as separate outcomes precisely for this reason, but each individual item is an imperfect proxy for the broader concept of normative democratic commitment. The supplementary regime legitimacy items available from Wave 3 onward (system support, no major change) produce consistent results, strengthening confidence in the pattern.

Third, while the system pride mechanism probe identifies significant individual-level moderation of the economic-preference relationship in Taiwan, the measure remains an indirect proxy for the democratic-national identity fusion the theory posits. System pride ("I am proud of our system of government") captures identification with the political system, which in Taiwan's context is reasonably interpreted as identification with democratic governance---but the item does not directly measure the fusion of democratic and national identity that the theoretical framework emphasizes. Direct measures of Taiwanese versus Chinese identity, available in some ABS waves but not consistently across all six, would provide a more definitive test. Moreover, system pride is available only from Wave 3 onward, reducing the sample relative to the full six-wave analysis. The finding that generic national pride does not moderate the relationship while system pride does is itself informative---it suggests the mechanism is specifically political rather than broadly nationalistic---but the distinction between system pride and democratic identity remains an inferential step that warrants further investigation with more targeted measures.

Fourth, the observation window closes in 2022, before both the Yoon martial law crisis and the most recent period of cross-strait tension that has reshaped Taiwanese politics. Wave 7 data, when available, will provide a critical test of whether the patterns documented here have persisted, deepened, or shifted in response to these events.

Finally, the two-country comparison, while analytically productive, necessarily limits generalizability. The performance-derived legitimation mode may characterize other post-developmental-state democracies in the region (and potentially beyond), but demonstrating this requires extension to additional cases.


# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

Democratic satisfaction is not democratic deepening. Two decades of Asian Barometer data from South Korea reveal that citizens can become simultaneously more satisfied with their democracy and less normatively committed to it---a pattern this paper has termed the satisfaction paradox. The mechanism is performance-derived legitimation: economic evaluations are powerfully and consistently associated with democratic satisfaction while showing no relationship with normative democratic commitment. Korean citizens evaluate their democracy instrumentally, and the evaluation is favorable, but the favorable evaluation does not deposit into a reservoir of principled attachment to democratic governance.

The Taiwan comparison demonstrates that this pattern is not an inevitable feature of East Asian democracies or Confucian political culture. Taiwanese citizens, operating within a similar developmental and cultural context, exhibit the opposite dynamic: economic comfort fuels more demanding normative evaluation of democratic quality. The divergence is statistically significant and substantively large, and it reflects, this paper has argued, two distinct pathways through which democratic legitimation was historically established---performance-derived in Korea, identity-fused in Taiwan.

These findings have implications that extend beyond the two cases examined here. For the study of democratic consolidation, they suggest that aggregate measures of democratic support---the percentage of citizens who express satisfaction with democracy or who prefer democracy to alternatives---can mask fundamentally different structures of support with different resilience properties. A polity in which 70 percent of citizens are satisfied with democracy for instrumental reasons and a polity in which 70 percent are satisfied for normative reasons will look identical in cross-national surveys but will respond very differently to performance shocks, legitimacy challenges, or authoritarian temptation. The satisfaction paradox is a reminder that the depth of democratic support matters as much as its breadth.

For the study of democratic resilience, the Korean case suggests an uncomfortable possibility: that democratic institutions can function effectively for decades, weathering presidential impeachments and even a martial law attempt, without generating the normative commitment that consolidation theory expects mature democracies to produce. Institutional resilience and normative resilience are distinct properties, and the former does not automatically generate the latter. South Korea's democratic institutions held in December 2024. Whether they would hold against a more patient, more competent, or more popular authoritarian challenge---one that could exploit the shallow normative foundations documented here---is a question that the satisfaction paradox makes it necessary to ask.

# Appendix H: Alternative Normative Commitment Measures {#sec-app-alt-norm .unnumbered}

The main analysis identifies a decoupling between economic evaluations and normative democratic commitment in Korea, measured by the "democracy is always preferable" item, alongside a critical citizens pattern in Taiwan on the same item. A natural concern is whether this finding is robust to alternative operationalizations of normative commitment or whether it is an artifact of one particular survey item.

Four alternative measures from the ABS are tested. Each captures a different facet of pro-democratic attitudes, and each is available across multiple waves in both countries:

(1) *Democracy is the best form of government* (Waves 3--6). This item asks respondents whether they agree that "democracy may have its problems, but it is still the best form of government." Despite its surface similarity to "democracy is always preferable," the two items differ in an analytically important way: the "best form" framing invites a comparative evaluation (best relative to available alternatives), while the "always preferable" framing demands an unconditional commitment (preferable regardless of circumstances). The pooled economic evaluation coefficient is positive and significant in both Korea ($\beta$ = 0.072, *p* < 0.01) and Taiwan ($\beta$ = 0.112, *p* < 0.001). Economically comfortable citizens in both countries are more likely to agree that democracy is the best available system---but in Korea this comparative endorsement does not extend to unconditional commitment.

(2) *Democracy versus economic development* (Waves 1--6). Respondents are asked to choose between democracy and economic development as the more important priority. After excluding the "both equally important" category (which does not lie on the democracy--economy continuum), the remaining four-point scale runs from economic development definitely more important to democracy definitely more important. The pooled coefficient is positive and significant in both countries (Korea $\beta$ = 0.196, *p* < 0.001; Taiwan $\beta$ = 0.192, *p* < 0.001), with no meaningful cross-country difference. When asked to prioritize democracy against economic development specifically, economically comfortable citizens in both countries favor democracy---consistent with the logic that material security frees citizens from prioritizing economic concerns.

(3) *Democracy is suitable for our country* (Waves 1--6). This 10-point item captures perceived fit between democracy and the respondent's national context. The pooled coefficient is positive and significant in both countries (Korea $\beta$ = 0.172, *p* < 0.001; Taiwan $\beta$ = 0.308, *p* < 0.001). The cross-country interaction is significant ($\beta$ = --0.160, *p* < 0.001), indicating a weaker positive effect in Korea than Taiwan---consistent with the broader pattern that economic evaluations are less tightly linked to democratic assessment in Korea---but notably the Korean coefficient is still positive and significant, not null. Economically comfortable Koreans do consider democracy more suitable; they simply do not translate this judgment into unconditional normative commitment.

(4) *Democracy is capable of solving society's problems* (Waves 1--6). This binary item captures perceived democratic efficacy. The pooled coefficient is positive and significant in both countries (Korea $\beta$ = 0.150, *p* < 0.001; Taiwan $\beta$ = 0.369, *p* < 0.001). As with suitability, the effect is substantially larger in Taiwan, but it is clearly present in Korea.

The pattern across all four measures is consistent. Economic evaluations are positively associated with conditional democratic endorsement in both countries. The Korea--Taiwan divergence appears exclusively on the "democracy is always preferable" item---the one measure that demands unconditional normative commitment rather than contingent assessment of democracy's merits, fit, or capacity. This result validates the theoretical distinction between diffuse and specific support that structures the paper's argument. Performance-derived legitimation, as theorized here, does not produce citizens who are hostile to democracy or who fail to recognize its merits; it produces citizens who endorse democracy instrumentally without developing the principled attachment that Easton's [-@Easton1965-ap] framework identified as the foundation of long-term regime stability.
