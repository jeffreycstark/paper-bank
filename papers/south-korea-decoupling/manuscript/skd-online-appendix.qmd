# Appendix A: Survey Instruments {#sec-app-instruments}

This appendix lists all variables drawn from the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS)
and the Korean Academic Multimode Open Survey (KAMOS) used in the analysis,
including exact survey question wording and scale coding. Variable names
reflect harmonized dataset conventions from the `survey-data-prep` pipeline.

# Appendix B: Disaggregated Dependent Variable Models {#sec-app-disaggregated}

The main text reports results using conceptual clusters. This appendix presents the core wave-by-wave OLS models with each dependent variable entered individually, organized into three conceptually distinct outcome families.

## B.1 Performance satisfaction {#sec-app-b1}

Items in this cluster capture evaluations of how well the current democratic system is performing. Both items are available across all six waves.

<!-- Table B1: Wave-by-wave OLS, DV = satisfaction with democracy (single item), Korea and Taiwan -->
<!-- Table B2: Wave-by-wave OLS, DV = satisfaction with government (single item), Korea and Taiwan -->
<!-- Key point: satisfaction with democracy shows smaller econ coefficients than government satisfaction, confirming that part of the index-level effect is driven by the government item's proximity to performance evaluation. Satisfaction with democracy is the cleaner performance satisfaction measure. -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*

## B.2 Normative democratic preference {#sec-app-b2}

Items in this cluster capture principled commitment to democracy as a form of government---whether citizens believe democracy is the right kind of system regardless of its current performance. Both items are available across all six waves.

<!-- Table B3: Wave-by-wave OLS, DV = democracy always preferable, Korea and Taiwan -->
<!-- Table B4: Wave-by-wave OLS, DV = extent democratic, Korea and Taiwan -->
<!-- Key point: "democracy always preferable" shows cleanest null in Korea and cleanest negative in Taiwan---this is the single strongest item for the paper's core claim. "Extent democratic" behaves somewhat more like a performance perception item, sitting between the satisfaction and normative clusters conceptually. -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*

## B.3 System legitimacy {#sec-app-b3}

Items in this cluster capture diffuse affect toward the existing system of government---pride in the system, preference for it over alternatives, confidence in its problem-solving capacity, and belief that it deserves support even when it encounters difficulties. These items are conceptually distinct from both performance satisfaction (which evaluates current outputs) and normative democratic preference (which evaluates democracy as a regime type). System legitimacy may be high under either democratic or authoritarian governance; it measures attachment to *this* system rather than attachment to *democracy*. All items are available Waves 3--6 only.

<!-- Table B5: Wave-by-wave OLS, DV = system_proud ("I am proud of our system of government"), Korea and Taiwan -->
<!-- Table B6: Wave-by-wave OLS, DV = system_prefer ("I would rather live under our system than any other"), Korea and Taiwan -->
<!-- Table B7: Wave-by-wave OLS, DV = system_capable ("Our system is capable of solving our country's problems"), Korea and Taiwan -->
<!-- Table B8: Wave-by-wave OLS, DV = system_deserves_support ("A system like ours deserves the people's support"), Korea and Taiwan -->
<!-- Table B9: Wave-by-wave OLS, DV = system_needs_change (reverse-coded: system works fine / minor change vs major change / replace), Korea and Taiwan -->
<!-- Key point: system legitimacy items are expected to show POSITIVE economic coefficients in both countries, because economic performance boosts affect toward the incumbent system regardless of legitimation pathway. This distinguishes system legitimacy from normative democratic preference, where the Korean null and Taiwanese negative are the core findings. If system legitimacy tracks economics while normative preference does not, it confirms that the decoupling is specific to the normative dimension. -->

# Appendix C: Measurement Comparability {#sec-app-comparability}

## C.1 Item wording stability across waves {#sec-app-c1}

<!-- Table C1: Side-by-side item wording for all DV and IV items across Waves 1-6, both countries -->
<!-- Document any wording changes, scale changes, or translation differences -->
<!-- Source: ABS codebooks -->

*[Table to be compiled from ABS codebooks]*

## C.2 Within-wave standardization {#sec-app-c2}

<!-- Table C2: Core models re-estimated using within-wave z-scores instead of 0-1 normalization -->
<!-- Key point: substantively identical results, demonstrating that findings are not artifacts of normalization choice -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*

## C.3 Ordered logit models {#sec-app-c3}

<!-- Table C3: Ordered logit on original ordinal items (satisfaction with democracy, democracy always preferable) -->
<!-- Korea and Taiwan, all waves -->
<!-- Key point: linear OLS approximation is adequate; ordered models produce same pattern -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*


# Appendix D: Survey Weights {#sec-app-weights}

<!-- Table D1: Core models (satisfaction, quality) re-estimated with ABS survey weights applied -->
<!-- Korea and Taiwan, all waves -->
<!-- Key point: weighted and unweighted estimates are substantively identical -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*


# Appendix E: Additional Robustness Checks {#sec-app-robustness}

## E.1 Institutional trust control {#sec-app-e1}

<!-- Table E1: Core models with institutional trust index added as control -->
<!-- Key point: econ → satisfaction relationship attenuates slightly but remains strong; econ → quality remains null in Korea, negative in Taiwan -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*

## E.2 Individual economic indicators {#sec-app-e2}

<!-- Table E2: Models replacing composite econ index with individual indicators (sociotropic current, pocketbook current, retrospective, prospective) -->
<!-- Key point: all types of economic evaluation show the same pattern; sociotropic evaluations slightly stronger, consistent with economic voting literature -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*

## E.3 Additional controls: partisanship, income, region {#sec-app-e3}

<!-- Table E3: Core models with party identification (where available), household income, and region fixed effects added -->
<!-- Key point: decoupling pattern robust to inclusion of partisanship and income controls -->
<!-- Note: party ID coverage varies by wave; report available waves -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*

## E.4 Placebo outcomes {#sec-app-e4}

<!-- Table E4: Economic evaluations predicting interpersonal trust, national pride, and life satisfaction -->
<!-- Key point: economic evaluations predict life satisfaction (expected) but not interpersonal trust or national pride, establishing discriminant validity of the satisfaction-quality dissociation -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*


# Appendix F: Taiwan Identity Mechanism Probe {#sec-app-identity}

<!-- Test whether the critical citizens pattern in Taiwan is moderated by national identity/pride -->

## F.1 National pride as moderator {#sec-app-f1}

<!-- Table F1: EconEval × NationalPride interaction predicting democratic quality, Taiwan -->
<!-- Expectation: negative econ → quality relationship is stronger among high-pride respondents -->
<!-- Rationale: in Taiwan, national pride is fused with democratic identity; proud Taiwanese are more likely to hold democracy to higher standards when economically comfortable -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*

## F.2 China threat perception as moderator (Taiwan) {#sec-app-f2}

<!-- Item: "Does China do more good or harm to the region?" (harmonized, 4-point scale) -->
<!-- Available: Waves 3-6 for Taiwan (W3 n=415, W4 n=1417, W5 n=1077, W6 n=1415) -->
<!-- Split: China-harm (responses 1-2) vs China-good (responses 3-4) -->

<!-- Table F2a: EconEval → quality models, Taiwan only, split by China harm vs good, Waves 3-6 -->
<!-- Table F2b: EconEval × ChinaHarm interaction predicting quality, Taiwan, pooled W3-6 with wave FE -->
<!-- Expectation: critical citizens pattern (negative econ → quality) is stronger among China-harm respondents, because cross-strait threat activates the identity fusion that anchors normative democratic commitment -->
<!-- Note: W6 (2022) shows sharp increase to 70% harm perception (post-COVID, heightened cross-strait tension). If aggregate critical citizens coefficient also strengthens in W6, this is converging evidence at both individual and aggregate levels. -->

*[Tables to be generated by 02_models.R]*

## F.3 Korea comparison {#sec-app-f3}

<!-- Table F3: Same national pride interaction for Korea -->
<!-- Expectation: null or weak interaction, because Korean national pride is not fused with democratic identity -->
<!-- Key point: national pride moderates the econ-quality relationship in Taiwan but not Korea, supporting the identity-fusion mechanism -->
