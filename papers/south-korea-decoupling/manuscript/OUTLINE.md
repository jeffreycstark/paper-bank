## Abstract (~250 words)

**Hook:** Democratic consolidation theory predicts that satisfaction with democratic performance and normative commitment to democracy should move in tandem, mutually reinforcing one another as democracies mature.

**Puzzle:** Six waves of Asian Barometer Survey data from South Korea (2003–2022, n = 7,603) reveal a striking dissociation: democratic satisfaction has risen steadily (+0.060 normalized units per decade) while normative democratic commitment has declined (preference for democracy: −0.059/decade; system support: −0.045/decade).

**Argument:** This paper argues that the dissociation reflects a distinctly *performance-derived* mode of democratic legitimation. Wave-by-wave OLS regressions demonstrate that economic evaluations are powerful predictors of democratic satisfaction (β = 0.38–0.58, p < 0.001 across all waves) but have no significant relationship with democratic quality perceptions from 2006 onward. The pattern holds across age groups, education levels, and multiple model specifications.

**Comparison:** A parallel analysis of Taiwan (n = 9,042) reveals a fundamentally different syndrome: economic evaluations predict satisfaction *and* are significantly negatively associated with democratic quality perceptions (β = −0.13 to −0.33), consistent with a "critical citizens" pattern in which economically comfortable citizens hold democracy to higher normative standards. The cross-country difference is statistically significant (interaction β = 0.138, p < 0.001).

**Contribution:** These findings challenge the assumption that democratic satisfaction signals democratic deepening, identify two distinct legitimation pathways in East Asia's most-studied democracies, and illuminate the conditions under which democratic institutions may be resilient yet normatively shallow — as illustrated by South Korea's December 2024 martial law crisis.

**Keywords:** democratic consolidation, democratic satisfaction, performance legitimacy, South Korea, Taiwan, Asian Barometer Survey

## 1. Introduction (~1,500 words)

### Opening vignette
The December 2024 martial law crisis: President Yoon Suk Yeol's invocation of democratic language to justify suspending democratic governance. The system's institutional guardrails held within six hours, yet the episode raises a fundamental question about what kind of democratic commitment underlies South Korea's consolidated democracy. Yoon was sentenced to life imprisonment in February 2026 — but the fact that a sitting president could attempt martial law in one of Asia's showcase democracies demands explanation.

### The puzzle
Present the core empirical finding: rising satisfaction, declining normative commitment. Two decades of ABS data show these trends moving in opposite directions. This contradicts the mutual reinforcement assumption in consolidation theory.

### Theoretical stakes
The distinction matters because different foundations of democratic support predict different resilience profiles. Socialization-based normative commitment (the American model) provides a floor during performance downturns. Performance-derived legitimation (the Korean model, this paper argues) does not. Democracy is evaluated instrumentally — "show me, please" — and support is conditional on continued delivery.

### The comparative leverage
Taiwan as the natural comparator: similar developmental state background, third-wave democratization, Confucian cultural context. But democratization in Taiwan fused with national identity (being democratic = being not-China), potentially anchoring normative commitment independently of performance. The comparison allows adjudicating between rival explanations for the Korean pattern.

### Contribution statement
Three contributions: (1) documenting the satisfaction-quality dissociation with systematic longitudinal evidence; (2) identifying the performance-derived legitimation mechanism through individual-level models; (3) demonstrating that the pattern is specific to Korea's legitimation pathway, not a generic East Asian phenomenon, through formal comparative analysis.

### Roadmap

## 2. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework (~3,000 words)

### 2.1 Democratic consolidation and the co-movement assumption

The Eastonian framework: diffuse vs. specific support. Linz and Stepan's consolidation criteria. Diamond's "deepening" expectation. Norris's "critical citizens" thesis as a partial challenge. The core prediction: as democracies mature, performance satisfaction and normative commitment should rise together because good performance reinforces legitimacy and strong legitimacy buffers downturns.

### 2.2 Challenges to co-movement: performance legitimacy in East Asia

The developmental state legacy. Park and Shin on "incomplete democratization" in Korea. Chu and colleagues on democratic support in East Asia. The "Asian values" debate and its empirical limitations. The key insight: if democratic legitimation was performance-based from the start (because democracy arrived alongside or after economic development), co-movement may never have been the operative dynamic.

### 2.3 Three pathways to democratic legitimation

**Typology (the paper's theoretical contribution):**

- **Socialization-based commitment** (paradigmatic case: United States): Democracy becomes part of national identity through civic education, founding myths, constitutional veneration. Attachment is prior to and independent of performance. Provides a normative floor.

- **Identity-fused commitment** (paradigmatic case: Taiwan): Democratic identity becomes inseparable from national identity through a specific historical configuration — in Taiwan's case, democratization as differentiation from authoritarian China. Normative commitment is anchored by identity, not performance, but through a different mechanism than socialization.

- **Performance-derived legitimation** (paradigmatic case: South Korea): Democracy is adopted and maintained because it delivers. Satisfaction is real but instrumental. Normative attachment remains shallow because it was never the basis of support. No normative floor exists independent of continued delivery.

### 2.4 Hypotheses

**H1 (Performance–satisfaction linkage):** Economic evaluations are positively and significantly associated with democratic satisfaction in both Korea and Taiwan.

**H2 (Korean decoupling):** In South Korea, economic evaluations have no significant relationship with democratic quality perceptions, indicating that satisfaction and normative commitment run on separate tracks.

**H3 (Taiwanese critical citizens):** In Taiwan, economic evaluations are negatively associated with democratic quality perceptions, indicating that economically comfortable citizens hold democracy to higher normative standards.

**H4 (Cross-country divergence):** The relationship between economic evaluations and democratic quality perceptions is significantly different between Korea and Taiwan.

**H5 (Universality of Korean decoupling):** The Korean decoupling pattern holds across age groups, education levels, and model specifications, indicating a society-wide legitimation mode rather than a subgroup phenomenon.

## 3. Data and Methods (~2,000 words)

### 3.1 Data source

Asian Barometer Survey, Waves 1–6 (2003–2022). Korea: n = 7,603 across six waves (~1,200 per wave). Taiwan: n = 9,042 across six waves. Nationally representative probability samples. Survey design and weighting.

### 3.2 Dependent variables

**Satisfaction cluster (two indicators):**
- Satisfaction with democracy (democracy_satisfaction): available all six waves
- Satisfaction with national government (gov_sat_national): available all six waves
- Combined as mean index; also analyzed individually for robustness

**Democratic quality cluster (two core indicators, available all waves):**
- Democracy always preferable (dem_always_preferable)
- Current democratic extent (dem_extent_current)
- Combined as mean index
- Additional indicators for robustness: system deserves support, system needs change (Waves 3–6 only)

All variables normalized to 0–1 scale.

### 3.3 Key independent variable

**Economic evaluation index:** Mean of six normalized indicators:
- National economic conditions (current)
- Household economic conditions (current)
- National economic outlook (next year)
- Household economic outlook (next year)
- National economic change (past year)
- Household economic change (past year)

All available across all six waves with high coverage.

### 3.4 Controls

Age (normalized), gender, education level (normalized), urban/rural residence, political interest (normalized). All available across all waves.

Additional controls in robustness checks: institutional trust index (mean of trust in national government, parliament, courts, political parties).

### 3.5 Analytic strategy

**Step 1: Descriptive trends.** Weighted wave means for satisfaction and quality clusters, documenting the divergence.

**Step 2: Wave-by-wave OLS regressions.** For each wave, estimate:
- Model A: Satisfaction = f(Economic evaluations, controls)
- Model B: Democratic quality = f(Economic evaluations, controls)

Compare coefficient magnitude, significance, and R² across models and waves.

**Step 3: Pooled models with wave interaction.** Test whether the economic evaluation coefficient changes over time (deepening performance dependence).

**Step 4: Formal cross-country comparison.** Pool Korea and Taiwan data; estimate country × economic evaluation interaction to test whether the decoupling pattern differs significantly.

**Step 5: Robustness checks.** Individual DV components; institutional trust as additional control; individual economic predictors; age/education/political interest subgroup analyses.

## 4. Results (~3,500 words)

### 4.1 Descriptive trends: The satisfaction paradox

Present Figure 1 (core dissociation plot) and wave means tables. Satisfaction rising from 0.456 to 0.525; quality declining from 0.366 to 0.351. OLS trend slopes. The divergence is modest in absolute terms but substantively significant given that consolidation theory predicts co-movement. Contextualize with political events (Park impeachment marked on plot).

Variable-level detail (Figure 2): satisfaction with government shows the most dramatic movement; democracy always preferable shows the steepest quality decline.

### 4.2 The mechanism: Economic evaluations predict satisfaction, not quality

**Core finding (Table 1 / Figure):** Wave-by-wave regression results for Korea.

- Satisfaction: β = 0.375 (W1) → 0.396 (W2) → 0.447 (W3) → 0.466 (W4) → 0.581 (W5) → 0.433 (W6). All p < 0.001.
- Quality: β = −0.207** (W1) → −0.064 (W2) → −0.015 (W3) → −0.029 (W4) → 0.007 (W5) → 0.005 (W6). Not significant from W2 onward.

Discuss the Wave 1 anomaly (negative significant quality coefficient in 2003 — possible post-IMF crisis effect).

R² comparison: economic model explains 9–18% of satisfaction variance but only 1–3% of quality variance.

### 4.3 Taiwan: The critical citizens pattern

**Parallel results (Table 2 / Figure):**

- Satisfaction: similar magnitudes to Korea (β = 0.38–0.69, all significant)
- Quality: consistently negative and significant in 5 of 6 waves (β = −0.13 to −0.33)

In Taiwan, economically comfortable citizens are *more critical* of democratic quality. This is the inverse of hollow satisfaction — it suggests normative engagement deepens with material comfort.

### 4.4 Formal cross-country comparison

Pooled model with country interaction. The Korea–Taiwan difference in the quality equation is highly significant (interaction β = 0.138, p < 0.001). Taiwan's negative economic → quality coefficient is −0.188; Korea's is only −0.050. The decoupling is formally and significantly different across the two cases.

### 4.5 Robustness

**Individual DVs:** Pattern holds for each satisfaction component separately. Government satisfaction shows stronger economic dependence (β = 0.575) than democracy satisfaction (β = 0.342). On the quality side, system deserves support and system needs change show significant *negative* economic effects — economically comfortable Koreans are less normatively supportive.

**Trust control:** Economic → satisfaction survives controlling for institutional trust (β drops from 0.453 to 0.352, remains highly significant). Trust independently predicts satisfaction but doesn't eliminate the economic channel.

**Individual economic indicators:** Every single economic variable significantly predicts satisfaction. Current evaluations show the cleanest decoupling; forward-looking measures show small negative quality effects.

**Subgroup analysis:** The decoupling is universal across age and education groups. However, politically interested Koreans show a weak critical citizens pattern (econ → quality: β = −0.100, p < 0.001) while low-interest citizens show pure decoupling. The minority of engaged citizens partially mirrors Taiwan; the disengaged majority drives the Korean pattern.

## 5. Discussion (~2,500 words)

### 5.1 Performance-derived legitimation as a distinct pathway

The results provide strong evidence for a performance-derived legitimation mode in South Korea. Democratic satisfaction is robustly and consistently driven by economic evaluations across two decades of survey data, while normative democratic commitment is essentially independent of economic conditions. Citizens evaluate democracy instrumentally: it is good because it delivers, not because it embodies inherently valuable principles.

### 5.2 Taiwan's divergent pathway: Identity-fused critical citizenship

Taiwan's pattern — where economic comfort is associated with *greater* normative scrutiny of democracy — is consistent with an identity-fused legitimation mode. When democratic identity is anchored by national identity (in Taiwan's case, differentiation from China), material comfort frees citizens to become more demanding of democratic quality rather than more complacent. This produces a more resilient form of democratic support.

### 5.3 The political interest finding: A Korean minority mirrors Taiwan

The most analytically interesting subgroup finding is that politically interested Koreans partially exhibit the critical citizens pattern. This suggests the capacity for identity-fused or normatively grounded democratic support exists in Korea, but only among the engaged minority. The challenge for Korean democratic deepening is expanding this pattern beyond the politically attentive public.

### 5.4 Implications for democratic resilience: The Yoon crisis

The December 2024 martial law crisis as a natural test of the theory. The institutional response was swift (martial law overturned in six hours, impeachment followed, life sentence delivered). But the theory predicts that institutional resilience does not guarantee normative resilience. The question is not whether democratic institutions held, but whether they held because of deep normative commitment or because the institutional machinery functioned as designed. The ABS data — showing rising satisfaction alongside declining normative commitment in the years preceding the crisis — suggest the latter.

### 5.5 Limitations

- Repeated cross-sections, not panel data: cannot track individual-level change
- The quality index uses only two indicators available across all waves
- Causal claims are limited given the observational design
- The Taiwan comparison uses secondary theoretical framing for the identity-fused mechanism
- Survey timing relative to political events may influence wave-specific results

### 5.6 Future directions

- Wave 7 data (post-Yoon crisis) as a critical test
- Extension to other performance-legitimation cases (Singapore, Vietnam)
- Panel data designs to establish causal direction
- Qualitative or experimental approaches to the socialization vs. performance mechanism

## 6. Conclusion (~500 words)

Democratic satisfaction is not democratic deepening. Two decades of Asian Barometer data from South Korea reveal that citizens can become simultaneously more satisfied with democracy and less normatively committed to it — a pattern driven by the instrumental evaluation of democratic performance through an economic lens. Taiwan's contrasting pattern demonstrates that this decoupling is not inevitable but reflects Korea's distinct pathway of performance-derived democratic legitimation.
