# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This research project investigates a puzzling phenomenon in Southeast Asian responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: why does Vietnam maintain the highest government approval ratings despite experiencing the highest infection rates, while Thailand shows low approval with moderate infections?

## The Vietnam Paradox

The core empirical puzzle driving this research is striking and counterintuitive:

## Key Finding

Despite experiencing a 65.9% COVID-19 infection rate—the highest among Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam—Vietnam simultaneously recorded:

-   **97.5%** government approval for pandemic handling (highest)
-   **91.9%** trust in government COVID information (highest)\
-   **2.6%** satisfaction with democracy (lowest)

This challenges fundamental assumptions about the relationship between governance outcomes and regime legitimacy.

## Research Questions

This project addresses four interrelated questions:

1.  **Why does the relationship between COVID outcomes and government approval vary across regime contexts?**
2.  **What mediates the connection between pandemic experiences and regime legitimacy?**
3.  **How do citizens distinguish between government performance and democratic quality?**
4.  **Under what conditions do citizens support expanded emergency government powers?**

## Three Regime Patterns

Preliminary analysis reveals three distinct patterns:

    A[Vietnam<br/>Authoritarian<br/>Effectiveness] --> B[High Infections<br/>High Approval<br/>Low Democracy]
    C[Cambodia<br/>Authoritarian<br/>Legitimacy] --> D[Low Infections<br/>High Approval<br/>Low Democracy]
    E[Thailand<br/>Democratic<br/>Crisis] --> F[Moderate Infections<br/>Low Approval<br/>Moderate Democracy]
```

## Theoretical Contributions

This research makes three primary contributions:

1.  **Challenges outcome-based theories of performance legitimacy** by demonstrating that authoritarian regimes can maintain support during crises despite poor objective outcomes

2.  **Explains mechanisms of authoritarian resilience** through information control and rally-around-the-flag effects

3.  **Demonstrates the value of distinguishing multiple dimensions of regime legitimacy** rather than treating citizen attitudes as unidimensional

## Data

**Source:** Asian Barometer Survey Wave 6 (2*020-2021***)\
**Countries:\*\* Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam\
**Sample Size:** \[To be filled from data\]\
**Key Variables:** Trust in institutions, democracy attitudes, COVID experiences, emergency powers support

## Project Structure

This analysis proceeds through four phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

-   Theoretical framework and hypotheses
-   Data preparation and cleaning
-   Descriptive analysis and pattern identification
-   Scale validation through factor analysis

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Testing (In Progress)

-   Interaction models testing country-specific effects
-   Mediation analysis of information environment
-   Moderator analysis of institutional trust

### Phase 3: Validation (Planned)

-   Robustness checks and sensitivity analyses
-   Final publication-quality visualizations

### Phase 4: Manuscript (Planned)

-   Complete manuscript integration
-   Online appendix with supplementary materials
