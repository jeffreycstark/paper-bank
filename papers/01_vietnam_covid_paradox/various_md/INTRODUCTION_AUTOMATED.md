On February 20, 2022, Vietnam officially acknowledged what its citizens had already experienced: a catastrophic surge in COVID-19 infections affecting nearly two-thirds of the population (`r round(vietnam$infection_pct, 1)`%). This admission came after months of the country's "living with COVID" policy, which abandoned earlier zero-COVID strategies in favor of accepting mass infections as inevitable. By any conventional metric, Vietnam's pandemic response had failed spectacularly—its infection rate was `r round(vietnam_vs_cambodia_infection_ratio, 1)` times higher than neighboring Cambodia (`r round(cambodia$infection_pct, 1)`%) and substantially higher than Thailand (`r round(thailand$infection_pct, 1)`%).

Yet when the Asian Barometer Wave 6 surveyed citizens across Southeast Asia in late 2022–2023, Vietnam recorded the highest government approval rating for pandemic handling: `r round(vietnam$approval_pct, 1)`% of respondents rated the government's performance as "fairly well" or "very well." This exceeded even Cambodia's approval (`r round(cambodia$approval_pct, 1)`%), despite Cambodia's relative success in limiting infections. Thailand, with moderate infection rates (`r round(thailand$infection_pct, 1)`%), recorded catastrophic approval ratings (`r round(thailand$approval_pct, 1)`%). Vietnam's paradox was complete: the worst health outcomes produced the highest government approval.

This finding contradicts fundamental assumptions about crisis politics and government accountability. Rally-around-the-flag theories predict that citizens unite behind leaders during external threats (Mueller 1970; Baker & Oneal 2001), but such rallies should strengthen when governments successfully protect citizens, not when they fail catastrophically. Economic voting theories suggest that citizens punish incumbents for poor crisis management (Lewis-Beck & Stegmaier 2000; Duch & Stevenson 2008), making Vietnam's high approval doubly puzzling. How can a government maintain near-universal support despite objectively disastrous pandemic outcomes?

Existing explanations prove inadequate. Performance-based accounts cannot explain why Cambodia (successful disease control) and Vietnam (catastrophic infections) achieved similar approval levels while Thailand (moderate outcomes) collapsed. Authoritarian repression theories fail because Vietnam did not hide pandemic data—infection rates were publicly acknowledged and widely experienced. Cultural explanations attributing Asian deference to authority cannot account for Thailand's low approval despite similar cultural contexts. Economic compensation mechanisms are contradicted by Vietnam's simultaneous economic hardship and high approval.

We argue that the Vietnam paradox reflects a more fundamental dynamic: authoritarian information control can successfully decouple government approval from objective performance during crises. In authoritarian regimes with effective information monopolies, what matters is not how many people suffer but rather how the regime frames that suffering. Vietnam maintained `r round(vietnam$trust_pct, 1)`% public trust in government COVID information despite mass infections, while Thailand's fragmented information environment produced only `r round(thailand$trust_pct, 1)`% trust despite better outcomes. This trust differential—not infection differentials—explains the approval paradox.

Our argument challenges conventional wisdom about crisis politics in three ways. First, we demonstrate that rally-around-the-flag effects are constructed through information control rather than automatic responses to threats. Personal infection had negligible impact on approval (r ≈ 0) across all three countries, contradicting theories assuming direct experience drives rally effects. Second, we show that authoritarian resilience during crises depends less on governance capacity than information control capacity. Cambodia succeeded through disease control; Vietnam succeeded through narrative control; both achieved high approval through different mechanisms. Third, we reveal that democratic accountability mechanisms—often celebrated as strengths—create vulnerability during crises when compared to authoritarian information monopolies.

These findings have profound implications for understanding authoritarian durability. If regimes can maintain legitimacy through information control regardless of performance, authoritarian vulnerability to catastrophic failures may be overstated. The question is not whether authoritarianism can survive crises, but whether it can survive information pluralism. Our evidence suggests modern authoritarianism has adapted information control mechanisms that remain effective even with widespread internet access and smartphone penetration.

We test these arguments using Asian Barometer Wave 6 data (2022–2023) from Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam (N = `r format(total_n, big.mark=",")`). These three countries provide theoretically informative variation: two authoritarian regimes (Cambodia, Vietnam) with different pandemic outcomes, and one democracy (Thailand) with moderate outcomes but low approval. We examine relationships between three types of COVID-19 impacts—personal infection, economic hardship, and trust in government information—and government approval ratings. Our findings consistently show trust effects (r = 0.51–0.67) dominating both infection effects (r ≈ 0) and economic effects (r = -0.14 to +0.16) across all three countries.

The paper proceeds in five sections. First, we review crisis politics literature and develop hypotheses about infection, economics, and information trust as drivers of approval. Second, we describe our data, measures, and analytical strategy. Third, we present descriptive evidence of the Vietnam paradox and individual-level correlations between COVID impacts and approval. Fourth, we discuss theoretical implications for crisis politics, authoritarian resilience, and democratic accountability. Finally, we conclude by considering what the Vietnam paradox reveals about information control as a mechanism of authoritarian durability in the modern age.
