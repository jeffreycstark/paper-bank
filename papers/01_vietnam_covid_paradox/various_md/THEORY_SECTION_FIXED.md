# Theoretical Framework

How do health crises affect government approval in different regime types? Existing theories offer competing predictions, yet none adequately explain the Vietnam paradox. In this section, we review three dominant theoretical perspectives—rally-around-the-flag effects, economic voting, and authoritarian resilience—before developing our information-based framework that explains why pandemic approval depends more on information environment than objective outcomes.

## Rally-Around-the-Flag: When Threats Unite Citizens Behind Leaders

Rally-around-the-flag theory predicts that external threats generate public unity behind national leaders (Mueller 1970; Baker & Oneal 2001). During crises—particularly those involving external enemies, national security, or survival threats—citizens suspend normal political divisions and support incumbent governments regardless of prior approval levels (Hetherington & Nelson 2003). This "rally effect" has been documented across diverse crises: international conflicts (Mueller 1973), terrorist attacks (Huddy et al. 2005), and natural disasters (Gasper & Reeves 2011).

The mechanism underlying rally effects involves several psychological processes. Threat perception activates heightened national identity and in-group solidarity, leading citizens to prioritize collective survival over political disagreements (Merolla & Zechmeister 2009). Leadership deference emerges as citizens grant leaders exceptional authority during emergencies, suspending critical evaluation in favor of trusting expert crisis management (Kam & Ramos 2008). Information scarcity during rapidly evolving crises creates uncertainty that advantages incumbent governments controlling official information channels (Baum 2002). Opposition silence prevents critical voices from challenging government narratives when dissent appears unpatriotic during national emergencies (Brody 1991).

Applied to pandemics, rally-around-the-flag theory predicts clear relationships between threat severity and approval:

- **Direct threat hypothesis**: Citizens who personally experience COVID-19 infections should exhibit higher approval as they perceive greater threat requiring government protection.

- **Collective threat hypothesis**: Countries with higher aggregate infection rates should show stronger rally effects as the threat appears more severe and widespread.

- **Successful protection hypothesis**: Governments that successfully limit infections should receive sustained rally effects as citizens reward effective threat mitigation.

These predictions fail spectacularly in the Vietnam case. Vietnamese citizens who contracted COVID-19 showed no higher approval than uninfected citizens (r = 0.013), contradicting the direct threat hypothesis. Vietnam's catastrophic infection rate (65.9%) did not weaken approval—it remained higher than Cambodia's approval despite Cambodia's successful disease control, contradicting the successful protection hypothesis. Rally-around-the-flag theory cannot explain why the worst health outcomes produced the best evaluations.

Moreover, rally effects typically prove temporary. Initial approval surges during crisis onset dissipate as the crisis persists and citizens evaluate government performance critically (Hetherington & Nelson 2003). The Asian Barometer Wave 6 surveyed citizens in late 2022–2023, more than two years after COVID-19's onset and months after Vietnam acknowledged catastrophic infection surges. Any initial rally effect should have long since dissipated, yet approval remained near-universal. Rally-around-the-flag theory predicts patterns opposite to what we observe.

## Economic Voting: When Material Conditions Determine Approval

Economic voting theory predicts that citizens reward governments for prosperity and punish them for hardship (Lewis-Beck & Stegmaier 2000; Duch & Stevenson 2008). This "pocketbook voting" mechanism operates both retrospectively (evaluating past economic performance) and prospectively (anticipating future economic conditions). During economic crises, incumbent approval should decline as citizens experience job loss, income reduction, and diminished living standards (Kayser & Peress 2012).

The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented economic disruption through lockdowns, business closures, supply chain collapse, and reduced consumer spending. Economic voting theory predicts clear approval consequences:

- **Personal economic hardship hypothesis**: Citizens experiencing job loss, income reduction, or economic suffering should reduce approval ratings as they blame governments for inadequate protection or compensation.

- **Aggregate economic performance hypothesis**: Countries experiencing greater economic disruption should show lower approval as collective economic pain translates into political punishment.

- **Government support hypothesis**: Economic relief programs (stimulus payments, unemployment benefits, business support) should moderate economic voting by cushioning material hardship (Bol et al. 2021).

The Vietnam paradox contradicts these predictions. Vietnam experienced substantial economic disruption alongside catastrophic infections, yet maintained near-universal approval (97.5%). Individual-level economic hardship showed weak and inconsistent approval effects across our three countries (r = -0.14 to +0.16), far smaller than economic voting theory predicts. Most puzzling, Cambodia exhibited a positive correlation between economic hardship and approval (r = 0.156), suggesting those suffering economically paradoxically increased their government support.

Economic voting theory faces additional challenges in authoritarian contexts. The theory assumes information pluralism enabling citizens to access alternative economic interpretations, attribution clarity allowing citizens to assign responsibility for economic conditions, and electoral accountability providing mechanisms to punish poor economic management (Anderson 2007). Authoritarian regimes may obscure economic data, control attribution narratives, or prevent electoral punishment, weakening economic voting mechanisms (Gehlbach & Simpser 2015). Yet this cannot fully explain Vietnam, where economic hardship was widely experienced and acknowledged but failed to reduce approval.

## Information Environment Theory: Trust Shapes Reality

We propose an information environment framework that explains why pandemic approval depends more on trust in government information than on objective health or economic outcomes. This framework synthesizes insights from media effects research (Zaller 1992), authoritarian information control scholarship (King et al. 2013), and crisis communication studies (Seeger 2006).

### The Information Environment Mechanism

Citizens evaluate government performance not based on objective outcomes but on their interpretation of outcomes, which depends fundamentally on the information environment they inhabit (Zaller 1992). During crises characterized by scientific uncertainty, rapidly changing conditions, and information overload, citizens rely heavily on trusted information sources to make sense of events (Lerner et al. 2003). Governments shaping which sources citizens trust effectively shape how citizens interpret crisis outcomes.

In authoritarian information environments, governments enjoy structural advantages: media control, censorship capacity, propaganda infrastructure, and opposition silence. These advantages allow regimes to construct dominant narratives about crisis causes, government responses, and outcome interpretations (Stockmann 2013). When successful, authoritarian information control creates narrative monopoly—citizens lack access to alternative interpretations that might frame government actions as failures. Personal suffering becomes reinterpreted through regime narratives: infections resulted from necessary trade-offs, economic hardship reflected global conditions beyond government control, or deaths would have been worse without government intervention.

In democratic information environments, pluralism prevents narrative monopoly. Opposition parties, independent media, civil society, and international information sources provide alternative interpretations of crisis events (Delli Carpini & Keeter 1996). Citizens exposed to competing narratives can critically evaluate government performance by comparing official claims against alternative accounts. This information pluralism enables democratic accountability—the mechanism by which poor performance translates into political consequences (Besley & Burgess 2002).

### Trust as the Critical Variable

The key mediating variable is trust in government information sources. When citizens trust government COVID information, personal infection experience or economic hardship gets interpreted through regime narratives that preserve approval. When citizens distrust government information, the same experiences get interpreted as government failures that reduce approval. Trust thus acts as a lens through which citizens interpret identical objective realities, producing opposite political consequences.

This framework generates several testable hypotheses:

- **H1 (Information Dominance Hypothesis)**: Trust in government COVID information will show stronger positive correlations with approval than personal infection or economic hardship in all three countries, regardless of regime type.

- **H2 (Infection Irrelevance Hypothesis)**: Personal COVID-19 infection will show negligible correlation with government approval, contradicting rally-around-the-flag predictions.

- **H3 (Economic Weakness Hypothesis)**: Economic hardship will show weak and inconsistent correlations with approval, contradicting economic voting predictions.

- **H4 (Authoritarian Information Advantage Hypothesis)**: Authoritarian regimes (Cambodia, Vietnam) will maintain higher trust in government COVID information than democracies (Thailand), enabling approval disconnection from performance.

- **H5 (Collective Information Hypothesis)**: The relationship between aggregate infection rates and aggregate approval operates through information environment rather than individual infection experience. Vietnam's paradox (high infections, high approval) results from high collective trust in government information, not from infected individuals rallying behind government.

### Mechanisms Across Regime Types

Our framework predicts distinct patterns across regime types:

- **Authoritarian Performance Success (Cambodia)**: High trust (regime legitimacy) + Good outcomes (low infections) → High approval through performance legitimacy.

- **Authoritarian Performance Failure (Vietnam)**: High trust (information control) + Poor outcomes (high infections) → High approval through narrative control.

- **Democratic Moderate Performance (Thailand)**: Low trust (information pluralism) + Moderate outcomes → Low approval through democratic accountability.

These patterns explain why objective performance matters in democratic contexts (where information pluralism enables accountability) but not authoritarian contexts (where information monopoly prevents accountability). The mechanism distinguishing successful authoritarian crisis management is not governance capacity but information control capacity.

### Scope Conditions

Our framework applies specifically to crises with three characteristics:

1. **High uncertainty** creates dependence on information sources for sense-making. Clear-cut crises with obvious causes and solutions may show weaker information environment effects.

2. **Widespread impact** ensures most citizens have direct or indirect experience requiring interpretation. Localized crises affecting few citizens may show stronger rally-around-the-flag effects.

3. **Sustained duration** allows information environments to shape interpretation over time. Brief crises may show different dynamics as initial information scarcity advantages governments.

COVID-19 satisfies all three conditions: scientific uncertainty about transmission, treatment, and prevention; near-universal impact through infections or restrictions; and sustained duration exceeding two years. These characteristics make pandemic politics an ideal test case for information environment theory.
