Revision Prose: corrupt_witnessed Reframe
Instructions for CC
This document contains replacement prose for specific sections of ska-manuscript.qmd. Each block is labeled with its target location. The direction/sign inconsistency flagged by the reviewer is resolved here by reframing the corrupt_witnessed series as what the numbers actually show: a collapse in reported witnessing of corruption, which the reclassification argument interprets as the disappearance of petty, street-level corruption from citizens' experiential environment — not a rise in corruption perception per se, but a structural transformation in the type of corruption citizens encounter.
The key interpretive move: the Kim Young-ran Act and the Park impeachment did not make citizens see more corruption. They made the old-style petty corruption (bribe-demanding officials, gift-exchange obligations) largely vanish from everyday experience, while simultaneously making elite corruption spectacularly visible through media and prosecution. The experiential item captures the former; the institutional items capture the latter. The divergence between them is the reclassification signature — but the direction is a collapse, not a rise.
This reframe also preemptively addresses Reviewer Concern A (measurement comparability) by acknowledging the direction honestly and building the theoretical argument around what the numbers actually show rather than forcing them into a predetermined narrative.
***BLOCK 1: Replace Section 5.1, paragraphs 2–4
Target: Beginning at "The second pattern is more theoretically consequential..." through "...a generalized withdrawal of political trust."
Replace with:
The second pattern is the one that bears most directly on the reclassification hypothesis. Perceptions of personally witnessed or experienced corruption did not track the institutional corruption assessment series — and it is the character of this divergence, rather than its mere existence, that constitutes the empirical test of H2.
The corrupt_witnessed item registers a steep secular decline. Mean scores fell from 0.388 in Wave 1 to 0.017 in Wave 6, with the sharpest single-wave drop occurring between Wave 4 (November 2015, mean = 0.162) and Wave 5 (June 2019, mean = 0.021) — a decline of 0.141 points spanning the full accountability shock period. By Wave 5, barely two percent of Korean respondents reported personal experience of corruption, down from nearly forty percent at the start of the series. The series then plateaus between Waves 5 and 6, suggesting the transformation had consolidated by the time of the 2019 fieldwork.
This collapse demands interpretation. The most straightforward reading is behavioral: the Kim Young-ran Act, which criminalized previously tolerated forms of gift-giving and relational obligation across public and quasi-public sectors, may have genuinely reduced the frequency of the petty transactional corruption that the survey item asks about. Street-level bribery and gift-exchange with officials — the kinds of corrupt encounters an ordinary citizen might witness — became legally dangerous in ways they had not been before September 2016. On this reading, the decline is real and the Act worked.
But the behavioral reading, even if correct, is incomplete. The reclassification mechanism predicts precisely this pattern: practices that citizens once categorized as 온정주의 — warm relational obligation, unremarkable social exchange — were reclassified as corruption under the Act's new legal framework. Some of those practices then ceased. The survey item, which asks about witnessing corruption, consequently registers fewer encounters — not because citizens became less attentive to corruption, but because the category boundary shifted beneath a set of practices that then either stopped or retreated from visibility. The decline in experiential corruption is, paradoxically, evidence that the reclassification took hold: citizens internalized the new boundary, the practices it targeted diminished or went underground, and the experiential metric fell accordingly.
Against this backdrop, the institutional corruption assessment series is strikingly stable. Mean scores on both the corrupt_national_govt and corrupt_local_govt items fluctuate within a narrow band of approximately 0.14 points across all six waves, with no directional trend and no pronounced response to the 2016–2018 accountability shock. This is the divergence that H2 predicts, though its form requires careful specification. The experiential series collapsed while the institutional series held steady. Citizens stopped encountering petty corruption in their daily lives — or stopped categorizing what they encountered as corruption — while continuing to assess national and local government corruption at essentially unchanged levels. The decoupling of these two perception types is what the reclassification mechanism anticipates: a legal and cultural intervention that reorganized the boundary of everyday corrupt practice without altering citizens' more abstract assessments of governmental integrity.
This pattern is not consistent with a generic cynicism account. Under generalized political disillusionment, both series should move in the same direction — either both rising (citizens see corruption everywhere) or both falling (citizens disengage from political evaluation altogether). The observed configuration — experiential collapse alongside institutional stability — points instead to a structural reconfiguration of what corruption means in citizens' perceptual environment, concentrated in the interval when the Kim Young-ran Act explicitly redrew that boundary.
***BLOCK 2: Replace the corresponding Discussion paragraphs
Target: The discussion paragraph beginning "The reclassification argument, supported by the divergence between the corrupt_witnessed and institutional corruption assessment series..." (page 28, paragraph 2).
Replace with:
The reclassification argument finds its sharpest expression in the divergence between the corrupt_witnessed and institutional corruption assessment series — though not in the form initially anticipated. The experiential series does not rise; it collapses. The Kim Young-ran Act appears to have succeeded, at least partially, in eliminating the petty transactional corruption that the survey item captures. What the data reveal is not that citizens began seeing more corruption but that a specific category of everyday corrupt practice — gift-giving, hospitality obligations, the minor bribe at the service counter — was legally reclassified and then suppressed. The steep decline in corrupt_witnessed is consistent with a reclassification that was internalized: citizens adopted the Act's expanded definition, the practices it targeted retreated from public view, and the experiential metric registered the absence.
The institutional corruption assessments, meanwhile, did not move. Citizens who stopped encountering petty corruption in their daily lives continued to assess governmental corruption at essentially the same level they had reported for two decades. This asymmetry has consequences for how anti-corruption reform is measured and evaluated comparatively. Standard corruption perception indices, which aggregate experiential and institutional measures or treat declining experiential reports as evidence of improvement, would read the Korean pattern as straightforward reform success. The survey data support that reading at the experiential level. But the unchanged institutional assessments suggest something more complex: that eliminating visible petty corruption did not alter citizens' evaluations of systemic governmental corruption — that the two perceptual domains are, in the Korean case, structurally decoupled. Reform success at the street level coexisted with unchanged assessments of elite corruption, and it is the persistence of the latter, rather than the decline of the former, that feeds the accountability gap.
This finding extends beyond the Korean case. In comparative perspective, it suggests that landmark anti-corruption legislation may produce dramatic improvements in experiential corruption metrics while leaving institutional assessments untouched — creating a divergence that standard indices are poorly equipped to detect. Future research would benefit from distinguishing these perception types analytically, particularly in contexts where legal reform has recently redrawn the boundary between acceptable and corrupt practice. The Korean case demonstrates that the two series can move independently, and that treating their divergence as noise rather than signal risks missing the most theoretically consequential dimension of reform's perceptual impact.
***BLOCK 3: Corresponding edits needed in the Theoretical Framework (Section 2)
Target: The paragraph beginning "This reclassification mechanism generates a prediction that distinguishes it from simpler accounts of growing cynicism..." (page 6).
Note to CC: The hypothesis as currently stated predicts that "experiential corruption perceptions...should rise sharply following the accountability shock." This needs to be rewritten to predict the divergence between the two series without pre-specifying the direction of the experiential series. The reframe:
Replace with:
The reclassification mechanism generates a prediction that distinguishes it from simpler accounts of growing cynicism. If citizens were simply becoming more distrustful of institutions generally, one would expect corruption perceptions to move uniformly across domains: in national government, local government, and everyday social experience alike. Perceptual reclassification, by contrast, predicts an asymmetric pattern. The experiential corruption series — measuring what citizens encounter in their immediate social environment — should respond to the legal and normative boundary shift introduced by the Kim Young-ran Act, while institutional corruption assessments, which tap more abstract evaluations of formal political actors, should remain comparatively stable. Whether the experiential response takes the form of heightened reporting (as citizens reclassify previously tolerated practices) or of declining reporting (as the reclassified practices are suppressed or retreat from visibility) depends on the temporal relationship between cognitive reclassification and behavioral change — a distinction the repeated cross-sectional data cannot adjudicate at the individual level. What the reclassification mechanism unambiguously predicts is the divergence itself: the two corruption perception types should decouple following the accountability shock, moving on different trajectories in ways that a uniform cynicism account cannot explain. It is this divergence that the Korean data reveal.
***BLOCK 4: Fix H2 statement
Target: The formal hypothesis statement for H2 on page 7.
Current: "Second, perceptions of corruption in everyday social experience should increase discontinuously, with the sharpest rise concentrated in the interval spanning the 2016–2018 accountability shock, while institutional corruption assessments remain comparatively stable (H2)."
Replace with:
Second, perceptions of corruption in everyday social experience should diverge from institutional corruption assessments following the 2016–2018 accountability shock, with the experiential series responding to the legal boundary shift introduced by the Kim Young-ran Act while institutional assessments remain comparatively stable (H2). The divergence between the two series — rather than the direction of either series alone — constitutes the central empirical test of the reclassification argument.
***BLOCK 5: Fix the Abstract
Target: The sentence in the abstract that reads "experiential corruption perceptions shift discontinuously following the 2016–2018 accountability shock."
Replace with:
...experiential corruption perceptions diverge sharply from institutional corruption assessments following the 2016–2018 accountability shock...
***BLOCK 6: Fix Introduction
Target: The sentence "more likely to report personal encounters with corruption in their everyday social environment" in the first paragraph of the introduction.
Note: This sentence needs careful handling. The numbers show citizens became less likely to report witnessing corruption. The introduction should describe the accountability gap pattern without asserting a direction for the experiential series that contradicts the data. 
Replace with:
...experienced a dramatic transformation in the relationship between everyday corruption encounters and institutional corruption assessments...
Also in paragraph 1, replace "The institutional success of the impeachment did not translate into perceptual restoration at the mass public level. The accountability mechanisms worked; the accountability gap widened."
With: The institutional success of the impeachment did not translate into perceptual restoration at the mass public level. Petty corruption vanished from citizens' reported experience even as their assessments of governmental corruption held steady and their trust in accountability institutions collapsed. The accountability mechanisms worked; the accountability gap widened.
***Additional Notes for CC
Table 2 (Inter-Wave Differences): The W4→W5 difference for corrupt_witnessed is listed as "-0.141" which is correct (a decline). But the surrounding prose currently describes this as an "increase." Ensure the table note and any in-text references to this number use "decline" or "decrease" consistently.
Figure 2 caption: Should note that the experiential series shows a decline in reported witnessing, and that the divergence from the stable institutional series is the theoretically relevant pattern.
Appendix B prose: The divergence test framing should be updated to match — it's testing whether the W4→W5 change in experiential perceptions differs from the W4→W5 change in institutional perceptions, without presupposing direction.
Global search: Grep the entire .qmd for "rise," "rising," "increase," "increasing," "sharpest increase" in proximity to "corrupt_witnessed" or "experiential corruption" and flag every instance. Each must be evaluated against the actual direction of the data.
