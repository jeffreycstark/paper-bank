***ABSTRACT (Sentences 003–005)
#003 — Abstract, Thailand finding
FIND:
In Thailand's pluralistic information environment, infection reduces approval only among citizens who distrust official information; in Vietnam and Cambodia, near-universal trust fully decouples outcomes from evaluations.
REPLACE:
Thailand tells a different story: in its more pluralistic information environment, infection reduces approval — but only among citizens who distrust what the government tells them. In Vietnam and Cambodia, where trust is near-universal, outcomes and evaluations have come apart entirely.
Technique: Register shift; "tells a different story" and "what the government tells them" break compressed academic efficiency
#005 — Abstract, mechanism statement
FIND:
We extend work on authoritarian "trust paradoxes" by identifying an information-based mechanism: when official narratives are deemed credible, citizens attribute negative experiences to forces beyond government control, allowing narrative credibility to substitute for performance outcomes as a basis for regime support.
REPLACE:
We extend recent work on authoritarian "trust paradoxes" by identifying a specific mechanism. It is not performance that sustains approval — it is the credibility of the story the government tells about that performance. When citizens deem official narratives credible, they attribute suffering to forces beyond state control. Narrative credibility substitutes for outcomes.
Technique: Break single 50-word sentence into four; controlled informality; punchy declarative ending
***INTRODUCTION (Sentences 006–013)
#006 — Intro opening
FIND:
The COVID-19 pandemic provided a natural test—governments that protected citizens from infection should enjoy higher approval than those that failed.
REPLACE:
The logic of performance legitimacy is intuitive. A pandemic arrives; governments that protect their citizens should be rewarded, and those that fail should be punished.
Technique: Start with evaluative claim; semicolon creates different rhythm; "intuitive" sets up reversal
#007 — Vietnam reversal
FIND:
Vietnam upends this expectation.
REPLACE:
Vietnam makes a mess of this logic.
Technique: Controlled informality — "makes a mess" is distinctively authorial
#010 — Paradox summary
FIND:
The worst outcomes coincided with the best evaluations.
REPLACE:
The worst outcomes produced — or at least coincided with — the best evaluations.
Technique: Self-interruption with em-dash creates human-sounding hesitation
#011–012 — Baniamin reference (merge two sentences)
FIND:
This pattern echoes broader puzzles in the study of institutional trust across Asia. Baniamin (2025) demonstrates that lower-performing countries like Vietnam show higher trust in government than better-performing democracies like Japan and South Korea, attributing this to authoritarian cultural orientation.
REPLACE:
The pattern is not unique to Vietnam. Baniamin (2025), analyzing fourteen East and Southeast Asian countries in the Asian Barometer, finds a similar inversion: Vietnam reports the highest government trust despite middling governance indicators, while Japan and South Korea — objectively better governed — report substantially lower trust. He attributes this to what he calls authoritarian cultural orientation.
Technique: Merge; "He attributes this to what he calls" is narrative citation style; em-dash aside
#013 — Mechanism proposal
FIND:
We propose a complementary but distinct mechanism: trust in crisis-specific government information may function as a cognitive filter, shaping how citizens interpret their experiences independently of diffuse cultural values.
REPLACE:
Our proposed mechanism is complementary but distinct. Crisis-specific trust in government information — not diffuse cultural deference, not generalized regime loyalty — may function as a cognitive filter, reshaping how citizens interpret what happens to them.
Technique: Split into two sentences; em-dash enumeration of what it's NOT; "what happens to them" is less formal
***THEORY 2.2: Information Credibility (Sentences 040–055)
#040 — Heuristic definition
FIND:
We formalize this as an information-credibility heuristic: citizens use their trust in official crisis information as a mental shortcut for evaluating government performance.
REPLACE:
We formalize this intuition as an information-credibility heuristic. The core claim is simple: citizens use their trust in what the government tells them about a crisis as a shortcut for evaluating how the government handled it.
Technique: "The core claim is simple" is metacognitive; "what the government tells them" is less formal register
#041 — Guriev and Treisman
FIND:
This mechanism resonates with Guriev and Treisman's (2019, 2020) concept of "informational autocracy," which argues that modern authoritarian regimes maintain power less through overt repression than through control over information flows and narrative dominance.
REPLACE:
The idea has antecedents. Guriev and Treisman (2019, 2020) argue that modern authoritarian regimes survive less through overt repression than through control over information flows — what they call "informational autocracy."
Technique: "The idea has antecedents" is a short lead sentence; reframe as narrative citation; shorter overall
#042 — Morgenbesser
FIND:
Morgenbesser (2020) situates such informational strategies within a broader "menu of autocratic innovation"—a repertoire of techniques through which regimes cultivate the pretence of accountability without permitting its actual practice.
REPLACE:
Morgenbesser (2020) pushes this further, cataloguing a "menu of autocratic innovation" — techniques through which regimes cultivate the appearance of accountability while blocking its practice.
Technique: "Pushes this further" is active/argumentative; shorter
#043–044 — Attributional ambiguity (merge/rewrite)
FIND:
The information-credibility heuristic matters because negative pandemic experiences are attributionally ambiguous. Infection can be interpreted as personal misfortune, an unavoidable feature of a global pandemic, or preventable policy failure.
REPLACE:
But why should any of this matter for a pandemic? Because getting sick is attributionally ambiguous. A Vietnamese citizen who contracts COVID-19 can blame bad luck, blame the virus, or blame the government. Nothing in the experience itself determines which.
Technique: Rhetorical question breaks expository flow; concrete case anchoring; punchy final clause
#045–046 — Trust and blame (rewrite)
FIND:
When official information is perceived as credible, citizens may accept government explanations and assign blame externally—attenuating the extent to which negative experiences translate into disapproval. When official information is distrusted, the same experiences may convert more readily into political blame.
REPLACE:
When official information is trusted, the government's framing wins: citizens accept that the virus was uncontrollable, that Hanoi did its best, that personal precautions matter more than state capacity. Blame flows outward. When distrusted, the same experience reads differently — and the same infection becomes evidence of state failure.
Technique: Concrete framings (Hanoi, specific claims); "Blame flows outward" is a two-word punch; em-dash
#047 — Political psychology transition
FIND:
This attributional logic draws on foundational work in political psychology.
REPLACE:
The underlying logic is well-established in political psychology, though it has rarely been applied to pandemic contexts.
Technique: "Though" qualification breaks affirm-affirm rhythm; adds a claim about novelty
#050 — Framework application
FIND:
Our framework suggests that trusted official information may help citizens make precisely this distinction: when the government's narrative is credible, citizens can attribute infection to the virus itself rather than to policy failure.
REPLACE:
What we add is a specific prediction about when the Healy-Malhotra pattern should break down. When citizens trust official narratives, they can distinguish between what the government controlled and what it could not. Infection gets attributed to the virus. Approval holds.
Technique: "What we add" is active authorial voice; two punchy declaratives at end
#051–055 — Pluralistic vs. restricted environments (consolidate 5 sentences)
FIND:
The mechanism operates asymmetrically across information environments. In pluralistic settings with competing narratives, citizens receive conflicting attributional frames—opposition voices may emphasize government culpability while official sources emphasize external factors. Citizens must adjudicate between frames, and those who distrust official information will weight critical narratives more heavily. In restricted information environments, the official frame faces less competition. Citizens who trust this dominant narrative have fewer alternative attributions available, potentially explaining why even severe negative experiences fail to translate into disapproval.
REPLACE:
The prediction has an asymmetric structure. In Thailand, where opposition media, street protests, and social media commentary offer competing frames, citizens who distrust official information can reach for alternatives — and those alternatives may emphasize government culpability. The accountability mechanism has room to operate. Vietnam is different. With the Communist Party controlling broadcast media and maintaining surveillance over online speech, the official frame faces almost no organized competition. A citizen who trusts the government's COVID narrative has, in practice, few alternative attributions available — which may explain why even severe personal infection fails to translate into political disapproval.
Technique: Concrete country details replace abstraction; "Vietnam is different" is a two-word register break; specific media details
***THEORY 2.1: Performance Legitimacy (Sentences 032–037)
#034 — Starker test
FIND:
Vietnam's COVID-19 experience presents an even starker test.
REPLACE:
Vietnam's COVID-19 trajectory sharpens the puzzle considerably.
#036–037 — Performance prediction + transition (merge)
FIND:
If performance drives legitimacy, Vietnam should show lower approval than Cambodia, which successfully controlled the virus. Something other than objective outcomes appears to sustain government support when performance visibly fails.
REPLACE:
On a strict performance-legitimacy account, the prediction is unambiguous: Vietnam should show lower approval than Cambodia, which kept infection rates an order of magnitude lower. It does not. Something else is doing the work.
Technique: Add falsification ("It does not."); "Something else is doing the work" is controlled informality
***CASE CONTEXT 3.2 (Sentences 102–109)
#102 — Cambodia opening
FIND:
Cambodia maintained low infection rates throughout.
REPLACE:
Cambodia's pandemic story was, on paper, a success.
Technique: "On paper" adds subtle qualification; register shift
#105 — Cambodia survey timing
FIND:
When surveyed in December 2021, Cambodian respondents were evaluating a government that had—by objective epidemiological measures—protected them from the pandemic.
REPLACE:
The December 2021 survey thus captured something rare in the region: citizens evaluating a government that had, by any epidemiological measure, done its job.
Technique: "Done its job" is controlled informality; "something rare" is evaluative
#106 — Thailand opening
FIND:
Thailand occupied a middle position epidemiologically but diverged sharply in its political context.
REPLACE:
Thailand's story was messier.
Technique: Ultra-short register break
#108 — Thailand politicization
FIND:
More consequentially, Thailand's pandemic response became deeply politicized.
REPLACE:
What mattered more than the case count was the politics.
Technique: Controlled informality
***CASE COMPARISON LOGIC (Sentences 111–116)
#112 — Analytical leverage
FIND:
These divergent trajectories create analytical leverage.
REPLACE:
The comparison is instructive precisely because the cases do not vary neatly on a single dimension.
#115–116 — Paired conditionals (consolidate)
FIND:
If performance drives approval, Cambodia should outperform Vietnam. If information environment matters, Vietnam and Cambodia should converge despite divergent outcomes—while Thailand should diverge despite moderate performance.
REPLACE:
The empirical predictions diverge cleanly. A performance-legitimacy account predicts Cambodia should outperform Vietnam — better outcomes, higher approval. An information-environment account predicts the opposite pattern: Vietnam and Cambodia converging despite opposite outcomes, while Thailand diverges despite moderate performance. Which prediction the data support is the question this paper answers.
Technique: Consolidate parallel "If X" structure; add forward-referencing closing
***MULTIVARIATE RESULTS (Sentences 142–148)
#142–144 — Results opening (consolidate)
FIND:
H1 predicts that information trust will predict pandemic approval net of institutional trust, democratic attitudes, and demographic controls. Table 2 presents multivariate OLS models testing this expectation. The trust coefficient survives intact.
REPLACE:
The multivariate models test whether the bivariate patterns survive controls — and they do, decisively. Table 2 tells the story.
Technique: Drop hypothesis restatement; lead with punchline; "tells the story" is register shift
#147 — Independence from deference
FIND:
This suggests the information-credibility mechanism operates largely independently of generalized deference.
REPLACE:
The information-credibility mechanism, in other words, is not just a relabeled version of diffuse regime support. It captures something distinct.
Technique: "In other words" is conversational; short punchy second sentence
***CONDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY + ROBUSTNESS (Sentences 153–167)
#156 — Vietnam/Cambodia null
FIND:
Vietnam and Cambodia present null interaction effects—but this supports rather than contradicts H2.
REPLACE:
What about Vietnam and Cambodia? The interaction terms are null — but that is the point.
Technique: Rhetorical question; punchy fragment-like response
#160 — Null interpretation
FIND:
The null interaction reflects not the absence of information effects but their completeness.
REPLACE:
The null is not silence. It is saturation.
Technique: Two ultra-short metaphorical sentences
#161 — Insert paragraph break before robustness
FIND:
Notably, even within Vietnam's compressed trust distribution, the standardized coefficient for trust (β = 0.31–0.41 across specifications) remains among the model's largest effects, indicating that the limited variation in trust that does exist still substantially predicts approval (see Online Appendix E). 4.5 Robustness We subjected findings to extensive sensitivity testing (full results in Online Appendix). Construct validity:
REPLACE:
Notably, even within Vietnam's compressed trust distribution, the standardized coefficient for trust (β = 0.31–0.41 across specifications) remains among the model's largest effects — the limited variation in trust that does exist still substantially predicts approval (see Online Appendix E).
4.5 Robustness
The robustness checks, detailed in the Online Appendix, interrogate these findings from multiple angles. The most consequential test asks whether our mechanism is merely a relabeled version of generalized regime loyalty. It is not: COVID information trust predicts pandemic approval 2–4 times more strongly than non-pandemic outcomes (democracy satisfaction, institutional trust), confirming domain-specificity.
Technique: Paragraph break between results and robustness; frame robustness argumentatively
#164–165 — Alternative specifications (consolidate)
FIND:
Alternative specifications: Ordinal logistic models treating approval as ordered categorical yield identical conclusions. Results are robust to robust regression, quantile regression, and survey-weighted estimation.
REPLACE:
Ordinal logit, quantile regression, robust regression, and survey-weighted estimation all confirm the pattern — the finding does not depend on modeling assumptions.
Technique: Merge two sequential summaries into one
#166–167 — E-values (rewrite)
FIND:
Sensitivity analysis: E-values range from 2.70 to 3.71, meaning an unmeasured confounder would need to nearly triple the risk of both high trust and high approval—simultaneously and independently of all observed covariates—to fully explain away the findings. For context, confounders of this magnitude are rare in observational research; most known confounders in political behaviour studies have substantially smaller effects.
REPLACE:
The sensitivity analysis raises the bar higher. E-values range from 2.70 to 3.71, meaning an unmeasured confounder would need to nearly triple the risk of both trust and approval — simultaneously, independently of everything we observe — to explain away the results. Confounders of that magnitude are, to put it mildly, unusual in political behavior research.
Technique: "Raises the bar higher" is argumentative; "to put it mildly" is controlled informality
***DISCUSSION 5.1 (Sentences 171–176)
#171 — Discussion opening
FIND:
Our findings support both hypotheses.
REPLACE:
Both hypotheses find support — though the pattern is more striking than either prediction alone anticipated.
Technique: Adds evaluative clause
#174–175 — Vietnam Paradox is real (rewrite)
FIND:
The Vietnam Paradox is real: the region's highest infection rate coincided with its highest approval. The information-credibility heuristic offers a compelling interpretation: trust in official communication functions as a cognitive filter through which citizens interpret their experiences.
REPLACE:
And the Vietnam Paradox is not a measurement artifact or a statistical curiosity. The region's worst pandemic outcomes produced its highest government approval. That demands explanation. The information-credibility heuristic offers one: trust in official communication functions as a cognitive filter through which citizens interpret what happens to them.
Technique: "That demands explanation" is assertive short sentence; "offers one" is clipped
***LIMITATIONS 5.2 (Sentences 183–191)
#183 — Opening
FIND:
Our cross-sectional design cannot establish causal direction.
REPLACE:
We should be direct about what this design cannot do. It cannot establish causal direction.
Technique: First-person metacognitive split
#185 — What we measure
FIND:
We measure trust in government information, not information control, propaganda effectiveness, or censorship.
REPLACE:
And we measure trust — what citizens report believing — not information control itself, not propaganda effectiveness, not the censorship apparatus that may produce that trust. The distinction matters.
Technique: Em-dash parenthetical; short punchy coda
#188 — Transition to evidence
FIND:
Several patterns favour the information-credibility interpretation over alternatives.
REPLACE:
That said, the evidence is not agnostic between interpretations.
Technique: Shorter; "That said" is register-appropriate; indirect framing
#190–191 — Halo effect argument (consolidate)
FIND:
If high trust in COVID information merely reflected a "halo effect" from pre-existing regime loyalty, adding these controls should substantially attenuate the trust coefficient. Instead, it declines by only 16–26%, retaining approximately three-quarters of its original strength, and the effect size remains substantively large (β > 0.31 across all countries).
REPLACE:
A "halo effect" from pre-existing regime loyalty would predict that adding institutional trust and democracy satisfaction to the model should substantially attenuate the information trust coefficient. What we observe is different: the coefficient drops by only 16–26%, retaining roughly three-quarters of its strength, with β remaining above 0.31 in every specification.
Technique: Merge conditional and result into single argument; "What we observe is different" is active
***LEGACY EFFECT (Sentences 203–209)
#203–204 — Legacy alternative (rewrite)
FIND:
A related alternative is that Vietnam's high approval reflects a "legacy effect"—citizens rewarding the government's successful 2020 containment rather than evaluating current conditions. On this account, early success earned a reservoir of legitimacy that citizens drew upon even as infections surged.
REPLACE:
There is a subtler alternative. Perhaps Vietnamese citizens are not evaluating the government's 2022 performance at all — perhaps they are coasting on gratitude for the successful containment of 2020, when Vietnam was the global poster child for pandemic response. On this account, early success earned a reservoir of legitimacy that citizens drew upon even as infections surged.
Technique: "Global poster child" is controlled informality; narrative; concrete historical reference
#206 — Empirical distinction
FIND:
The distinction matters empirically.
REPLACE:
How would we tell the difference?
Technique: Rhetorical question
#209 — Filtering vs. coasting
FIND:
Citizens appear to be filtering current experiences through current trust in official narratives, not simply coasting on stored legitimacy from 2020.
REPLACE:
The evidence points toward active filtering, not stored goodwill. Citizens appear to be interpreting ongoing experiences through a lens of current narrative trust — not drawing down a reservoir filled in 2020.
Technique: Metaphor ("drawing down a reservoir"); split into two sentences
***SOCIAL DESIRABILITY (Sentences 220–227)
#220 — Opening
FIND:
Social desirability bias deserves particular attention.
REPLACE:
The most uncomfortable question is whether any of these numbers are real.
Technique: Provocative framing; controlled informality
#222–223 — Cannot rule out (consolidate)
FIND:
We cannot definitively rule this out with observational data. However, several patterns suggest social desirability does not fully explain our findings.
REPLACE:
We cannot rule it out — no observational study can. But the data contain internal checks that are hard to square with uniform fear.
Technique: Shorter; em-dash; "hard to square with" is register shift
#226 — Fear prediction
FIND:
If fear uniformly inflates all pro-government responses, we would expect those who perceive constraints to show lower approval, or at least to avoid criticizing speech freedoms in the first place.
REPLACE:
Think about what uniform social desirability bias would actually predict. Citizens afraid to criticize the government should either avoid criticizing speech freedoms entirely or, if they do criticize them, should show lower pandemic approval. Neither pattern appears.
Technique: "Think about" is direct address; imperative mood; "Neither pattern appears" is punchy
***IMPLICATIONS 5.3 (Sentences 232–241)
#232–234 — Accountability implications (rewrite)
FIND:
Our results suggest this assumption may fail when official narratives successfully frame outcomes as beyond government control. The Thailand results are instructive: accountability functioned among citizens who distrusted official information, suggesting the mechanism itself operates—but only when citizens have access to, and confidence in, alternative attributional frames. Democratic accountability may thus depend not only on electoral institutions but on information environments that permit critical evaluation of official narratives.
REPLACE:
Our results suggest this assumption may fail when official narratives successfully frame outcomes as beyond government control. Thailand is the proof of concept: accountability functioned, but only among citizens who distrusted official information — only, that is, among those who had access to alternative attributional frames and confidence in them. The implication is unsettling. Democratic accountability may depend not only on electoral institutions but on information environments that give citizens the raw material for critical evaluation.
Technique: "Thailand is the proof of concept" is register shift; "The implication is unsettling" is evaluative short sentence; "raw material" is metaphorical
#235–238 — Public health (consolidate 4 sentences)
FIND:
For public health communication, these findings present a double-edged implication. On one hand, maintaining public trust in official health information appears consequential for social cohesion during crises—citizens who trust official sources may be more resilient to the psychological and political disruptions of negative health outcomes. On the other hand, this same dynamic could insulate governments from accountability for genuine policy failures, reducing incentives for effective crisis management. The normative valence depends on whether high trust reflects genuinely competent communication or successful narrative control despite poor performance—a distinction our cross-sectional data cannot adjudicate.
REPLACE:
For public health practitioners, the findings cut both ways — and we want to be honest about the discomfort. Trust in official information clearly helps: citizens who trust official sources appear more resilient to the political disruptions that pandemics bring. But the same mechanism that maintains social cohesion in Hanoi could shield incompetent crisis management in a future pandemic elsewhere. Whether high trust reflects good communication or successful narrative control is precisely the question our data cannot answer.
Technique: "We want to be honest about the discomfort" is metacognitive; "in Hanoi" is concrete; collapses 4 sentences to 4 with varied rhythm
#240–241 — Guriev and Treisman extension (consolidate)
FIND:
Our findings provide individual-level evidence consistent with Guriev and Treisman's (2019) informational autocracy framework: when citizens trust official narratives, objective performance becomes less consequential for political support. This extends their macro-level argument about regime survival to micro-level survey evidence about individual attitudes.
REPLACE:
At the individual level, these findings provide micro-level survey evidence for what Guriev and Treisman (2019) theorized at the regime level: when citizens trust official narratives, objective performance becomes less consequential for political survival — and for the attitudes that sustain it.
Technique: Single sentence; em-dash extension rather than separate sentence
***CONCLUSION (Sentences 244–257, 259–264)
#244 — Normative caution
FIND:
We caution against normative conclusions about "authoritarian advantages" in crisis management.
REPLACE:
One conclusion we resist: that authoritarianism is good for pandemics.
Technique: Controlled informality; shorter; active
#245 — Thailand accountability
FIND:
Thailand's low approval could indicate democratic accountability functioning appropriately—citizens punishing a government they perceive as having failed—rather than democratic vulnerability.
REPLACE:
Thailand's 37.5% approval rating might be, from a democratic-theory standpoint, exactly what it should be — citizens holding a government accountable for perceived failures. That is not a pathology.
Technique: Concrete number; "That is not a pathology" is punchy declarative
#247 — Foundational challenge
FIND:
If narrative credibility can substitute for actual performance, the informational foundations of democratic accountability deserve closer scrutiny.
REPLACE:
If what people believe about outcomes matters more than what the outcomes actually were, then the field's foundational assumption — that democratic accountability runs on performance evaluation — needs revisiting.
Technique: Longer, more complex; rephrases abstract claim concretely
#250–251 — Numbers summary (rewrite)
FIND:
Our findings support an information-credibility framework. Trust in government COVID-19 information strongly predicted approval (β = 0.41 to 0.69), explaining 26–45% of variance, while personal infection showed null effects across all three countries.
REPLACE:
The numbers bear repeating. Trust in official COVID-19 information predicted approval with β coefficients of 0.41 to 0.69, explaining between a quarter and nearly half of all variance. Personal infection? Null effects across all three countries.
Technique: "The numbers bear repeating" is authorial; rhetorical question + fragment answer
#254–255 — Conditional mechanism (consolidate)
FIND:
The accountability mechanism is not absent; it is conditional on information environment. When the cognitive filter of trusted narratives is removed, the performance-legitimacy link functions normally.
REPLACE:
Accountability is not absent from these data — it is conditional. Remove the filter of trusted narratives, as Thailand's low-trust respondents demonstrate, and the performance-legitimacy link works exactly as the textbooks predict.
Technique: Concrete anchoring ("Thailand's low-trust respondents"); "as the textbooks predict" is informality
#256–257 — General theory (rewrite)
FIND:
This transforms our findings from a regional anomaly into evidence for a general theory: information trust moderates whether citizens translate personal experiences into political evaluations. Vietnam and Cambodia represent ceiling cases where near-universal trust has decoupled outcomes from evaluations entirely.
REPLACE:
The Vietnam Paradox, then, is not a regional curiosity. It is evidence for a general claim: information trust moderates whether citizens translate what happens to them into political judgments. Vietnam and Cambodia are ceiling cases — places where trust is so pervasive that the moderation is total and outcomes have stopped mattering.
Technique: "Then" carries argument; "places where" is informal; "outcomes have stopped mattering" is punchy
#260–261 — Limitations acknowledgment (consolidate)
FIND:
We acknowledge limitations. Our cross-sectional design cannot establish causality, and high trust could reflect genuinely effective communication rather than narrative manipulation.
REPLACE:
These findings come with the usual caveat — cross-sectional data cannot establish causality — and an unusual one: we cannot distinguish between trust earned through competent communication and trust manufactured through narrative control.
Technique: Single sentence with em-dash structure; "the usual caveat...and an unusual one" is authorial
#262–263 — Awaiting confirmation (rewrite)
FIND:
The interpretation we favour awaits confirmation from longitudinal or experimental designs. But what the evidence establishes is a robust empirical pattern demanding theoretical attention.
REPLACE:
Longitudinal or experimental designs will eventually adjudicate. For now, the empirical pattern is robust enough to demand theoretical attention on its own terms.
Technique: Shorter; "on its own terms" adds voice
#264 — Final sentence
FIND:
If governments can maintain trusted narratives during crises, objective outcomes may become politically irrelevant—a troubling prospect for theories grounding democratic accountability in citizens' ability to evaluate governmental performance.
REPLACE:
If a government can maintain a trusted narrative during a crisis — and Vietnam's 97.5% approval amid 65.9% infection suggests that some governments can — then objective outcomes may become politically irrelevant. For theories that ground democratic accountability in citizens' ability to evaluate performance, that is not a minor complication. It is a foundational challenge.
Technique: Concrete numbers in parenthetical; final thought broken into two sentences ending with punchy declarative
