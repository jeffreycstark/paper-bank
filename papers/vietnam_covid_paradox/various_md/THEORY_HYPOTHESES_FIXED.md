This framework generates several testable hypotheses:

- **H1 (Information Dominance Hypothesis)**: Trust in government COVID information will show stronger positive correlations with approval than personal infection or economic hardship in all three countries, regardless of regime type.

- **H2 (Infection Irrelevance Hypothesis)**: Personal COVID-19 infection will show negligible correlation with government approval, contradicting rally-around-the-flag predictions.

- **H3 (Economic Weakness Hypothesis)**: Economic hardship will show weak and inconsistent correlations with approval, contradicting economic voting predictions.

- **H4 (Authoritarian Information Advantage Hypothesis)**: Authoritarian regimes (Cambodia, Vietnam) will maintain higher trust in government COVID information than democracies (Thailand), enabling approval disconnection from performance.

- **H5 (Collective Information Hypothesis)**: The relationship between aggregate infection rates and aggregate approval operates through information environment rather than individual infection experience. Vietnam's paradox (high infections, high approval) results from high collective trust in government information, not from infected individuals rallying behind government.

**Mechanisms Across Regime Types.** Our framework predicts distinct patterns across regime types:

- **Authoritarian Performance Success (Cambodia)**: High trust (regime legitimacy) + Good outcomes (low infections) → High approval through performance legitimacy.

- **Authoritarian Performance Failure (Vietnam)**: High trust (information control) + Poor outcomes (high infections) → High approval through narrative control.

- **Democratic Moderate Performance (Thailand)**: Low trust (information pluralism) + Moderate outcomes → Low approval through democratic accountability.

These patterns explain why objective performance matters in democratic contexts (where information pluralism enables accountability) but not authoritarian contexts (where information monopoly prevents accountability). The mechanism distinguishing successful authoritarian crisis management is not governance capacity but information control capacity.

**Scope Conditions.** Our framework applies specifically to crises with three characteristics:

1. **High uncertainty** creates dependence on information sources for sense-making. Clear-cut crises with obvious causes and solutions may show weaker information environment effects.

2. **Widespread impact** ensures most citizens have direct or indirect experience requiring interpretation. Localized crises affecting few citizens may show stronger rally-around-the-flag effects.

3. **Sustained duration** allows information environments to shape interpretation over time. Brief crises may show different dynamics as initial information scarcity advantages governments.

COVID-19 satisfies all three conditions: scientific uncertainty about transmission, treatment, and prevention; near-universal impact through infections or restrictions; and sustained duration exceeding two years. These characteristics make pandemic politics an ideal test case for information environment theory.
