# Appendix A: Survey Question Wording {#sec-appendix-questions}

This appendix documents the exact wording of all Asian Barometer Wave 6 survey items used in our analysis. For each measure, we provide the original question text, response options, and any coding notes relevant to interpretation.

## A.1 Dependent Variable

**Government Pandemic Handling** (q142)

*Question:* "How well or badly do you think the government handled the pandemic?"

*Response options:* (1) Very badly; (2) Badly; (3) Quite well; (4) Very well

*Coding:* Higher values indicate more favourable evaluations. This item serves as the primary dependent variable throughout the analysis.

---

## A.2 Primary Independent Variables

### A.2.1 COVID-19 Infection

**Personal/Family COVID Infection** (q138)

*Question:* "Have you or your family members previously contracted the COVID-19 virus?"

*Response options:* (0) No; (1) Yes

*Coding:* Binary indicator. Note that this item captures household-level exposure rather than personal infection alone, which may inflate prevalence estimates compared to individual-only measures.

### A.2.2 Trust in COVID Information

**Trust in Government COVID Information** (q141)

*Question:* "How much do you trust the Covid-19 related information provided by the government?"

*Response options:* (1) No trust at all; (2) Not a lot of trust; (3) Quite a lot of trust; (4) A great deal of trust

*Coding:* Higher values indicate greater trust. This item serves as the key mediating variable in our theoretical framework.

### A.2.3 Economic Impact

**COVID-19 Economic Impact** (q140)

*Question:* "Thinking of the negative impact of COVID-19 on your family's livelihood, how serious is it in your view?"

*Response options:* (1) Not much impact; (2) Some impact, but not serious; (3) Serious impact; (4) Very serious impact

*Coding:* Higher values indicate greater perceived economic hardship from the pandemic.

---

## A.3 Institutional Trust Index

**Institutional Trust** (q7--q15)

*Stem question:* "I'm going to name a number of institutions. For each one, please tell me how much trust do you have in them?"

*Institutions:*

| Item | Institution |
|------|-------------|
| q7   | National government |
| q8   | Courts |
| q9   | Police |
| q10  | Political parties |
| q11  | Parliament/National Assembly |
| q12  | Civil service |
| q13  | Military |
| q14  | Election commission |
| q15  | Local government |

*Response options (all items):* (1) None at all; (2) Not very much trust; (3) Quite a lot of trust; (4) A great deal of trust

*Index construction:* Mean of all nine items, standardised to a 1--4 scale. Higher values indicate greater institutional trust. Cronbach's α > 0.90 across all three countries.

---

## A.4 Authoritarian Acceptance Index

**Authoritarian Governance Acceptance** (q168--q171)

*Items:*

| Item | Statement |
|------|-----------|
| q168 | "In order to solve the country's urgent problems, a leader can govern the country by decrees and disregard the parliament if necessary." |
| q169 | "As long as a government can solve our country's economic problem, it does not matter if the government holds regular elections or not." |
| q170 | "This country needs a leader who can break the rules if necessary to get things done." |
| q171 | "As long as the government can maintain order and stability in the country, it does not matter whether it is democratic or undemocratic." |

*Response options (all items):* (1) Strongly disagree; (2) Somewhat disagree; (3) Somewhat agree; (4) Strongly agree

*Index construction:* Mean of all four items. Higher values indicate greater acceptance of authoritarian governance practices. Items were originally coded such that agreement indicated authoritarian acceptance; no reverse-coding was applied. Cronbach's α = 0.85.

---

## A.5 Democratic Attitudes

**Satisfaction with Democracy** (q90)

*Question:* "On the whole, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the way democracy works in [COUNTRY]?"

*Response options:* (1) Not at all satisfied; (2) Not very satisfied; (3) Fairly satisfied; (4) Very satisfied

*Coding:* Higher values indicate greater satisfaction. This item is used both as a control variable and as a falsification test outcome in sensitivity analyses.

---

## A.6 Social Desirability Check

**Freedom of Speech Perception** (q106)

*Question:* "People are free to speak what they think without fear."

*Response options:* (1) Strongly disagree; (2) Somewhat disagree; (3) Somewhat agree; (4) Strongly agree

*Coding:* This item is used in the Discussion section to test social desirability bias. Respondents who disagree (responses 1--2) are coded as perceiving speech constraints, providing a subsample for robustness checks.

```{r}
#| label: load-speech-stats
#| echo: false
#| message: false

# Load speech freedom statistics (by country)
speech_stats <- readRDS(here::here("tables", "speech_freedom_stats.rds"))

# Load speech freedom + approval statistics (Vietnam only)
speech_approval_stats <- readRDS(here::here("tables", "speech_freedom_approval_stats.rds"))

# Extract values for inline use
vietnam_constrained <- speech_stats %>% filter(country_name == "Vietnam") %>% pull(pct_constrained)
vietnam_free <- speech_stats %>% filter(country_name == "Vietnam") %>% pull(pct_free)
cambodia_constrained <- speech_stats %>% filter(country_name == "Cambodia") %>% pull(pct_constrained)
thailand_constrained <- speech_stats %>% filter(country_name == "Thailand") %>% pull(pct_constrained)
approval_constrained <- speech_approval_stats$approval_among_constrained
approval_free <- speech_approval_stats$approval_among_free
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-social-desirability
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Perceived Speech Constraints by Country"
#| echo: false

speech_stats %>%
  select(Country = country_name,
         N = n,
         `% Constrained` = pct_constrained,
         `% Free` = pct_free) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = c("l", "r", "r", "r"),
               format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```

*Descriptive Statistics:* The table above presents the percentage of respondents who perceive constraints on free speech (disagree that people are free to speak without fear). Vietnamese respondents report substantially higher perceived constraints (`r vietnam_constrained`%) compared to Cambodian (`r cambodia_constrained`%) and Thai (`r thailand_constrained`%) respondents. Alternatively, `r vietnam_free`% of Vietnamese respondents perceive speech freedom (agree people are free to speak), compared to only `r speech_stats %>% filter(country_name == "Cambodia") %>% pull(pct_free)`% in Cambodia and `r speech_stats %>% filter(country_name == "Thailand") %>% pull(pct_free)`% in Thailand. This paradox---higher perceived freedom in the more authoritarian context---is referenced in the Discussion section's social desirability analysis. The fact that Vietnamese respondents openly report substantial speech constraints (alongside high infection rates) suggests responses are not uniformly driven by fear.

*Note:* "Constrained" = Disagree/Strongly disagree that "people are free to speak what they think without fear" (freedom_of_speech ≤ 2, reverse-coded from q106 ≥ 3). "Free" = Agree/Strongly agree (freedom_of_speech ≥ 3, reverse-coded from q106 ≤ 2). Statistics from validated dataset excluding missing values.

*Social Desirability Test (Vietnam):* Even assuming social desirability inflates reports of free speech, the `r round(vietnam_constrained, 1)`% of Vietnamese respondents who openly disagreed that "people are free to speak without fear" represent those least susceptible to such pressure. Yet their approval of pandemic handling (`r round(approval_constrained, 1)`%) is virtually identical to those who report feeling free (`r round(approval_free, 1)`%). If fear were driving responses, these respondents---who already demonstrated willingness to offer "risky" answers---should show lower approval. They do not.

```{r}
#| label: load-correlation-stats
#| echo: false
#| message: false

# Load correlation statistics
cor_stats <- readRDS(here::here("tables", "freedom_approval_correlation.rds"))
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-freedom-approval-correlation
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Correlation Between Freedom of Speech and Government Pandemic Approval (Vietnam)"
#| echo: false

tibble(
  Measure = c("N", "Correlation (r)", "95% CI", "p-value", "Mean Freedom of Speech", "Mean Govt Approval"),
  Value = c(
    format(cor_stats$n, big.mark = ","),
    sprintf("%.3f", cor_stats$correlation),
    sprintf("[%.3f, %.3f]", cor_stats$ci_lower, cor_stats$ci_upper),
    sprintf("%.3f", cor_stats$p_value),
    sprintf("%.2f", cor_stats$mean_freedom),
    sprintf("%.2f", cor_stats$mean_approval)
  )
) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = c("l", "r"))
```

The table above presents the correlation between perceived speech freedom and government pandemic approval. The correlation is positive but substantively negligible (r = `r round(cor_stats$correlation, 3)`, p = `r round(cor_stats$p_value, 3)`), indicating that perceptions of speech freedom have virtually no relationship with approval ratings. This near-zero correlation further undermines the social desirability explanation: if fear of reprisal drove both high approval and reports of freedom, we would expect a much stronger positive relationship.

*Note:* Both variables are 4-point scales where higher values indicate more agreement. Correlation uses Pearson's r with complete cases only. The weak correlation (r < 0.10) indicates perceived speech freedom explains less than 1% of variance in approval ratings.

if (!is.null(scale_reliability)) {

    filter(scale %in% c("Institutional Trust", "Auth Acceptance", "Emergency Powers")) %>%
    select(
      Scale = scale,
      `Items` = n_items,

  }
} else {
  cat("Scale reliability data not available.\n")
}
```

All composite scales demonstrate acceptable to excellent internal consistency. The Institutional Trust Index shows particularly high reliability (α > 0.90), reflecting strong intercorrelations among trust items across different governmental and judicial institutions.


# Appendix C: Measurement Validity Diagnostics {#sec-appendix-validity}

A key concern is whether trust in government COVID information and government pandemic approval measure distinct constructs or simply tap the same underlying attitude of regime support.

## Table C1: Correlation Matrix (Vietnam)

```{r table-c1}
#| label: tbl-correlation-vietnam

      add_footer_lines("Note: Pearson correlations. Trust-Approval r = 0.51, indicating 74% independent variance.")
  } else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
    # Use kable for PDF - use short abbreviated names

      "covid_trust_info" = "COVID_Trust",
      "institutional_trust_index" = "Inst_Trust",
      "dem_satisfaction" = "Dem. Sat.",
      "covid_contracted" = "Infected"
    )

    # Apply to Variable column (row names)
    tbl_data_renamed$Variable <- short_names[tbl_data_renamed$Variable]

    # Apply to column names
    names(tbl_data_renamed) <- short_names[names(tbl_data_renamed)]

    tbl_data_renamed %>%
      kable(
        format = "latex",
        booktabs = TRUE,
        digits = 3
      ) %>%
      kable_styling(
        latex_options = c("hold_position"),
        full_width = TRUE,
        font_size = 10
      ) %>%
      kableExtra::footnote(general = "Handling = COVID govt handling; COVID_Trust = COVID trust info; Inst_Trust = Institutional trust index; Dem. Sat. = Democracy satisfaction; Infected = COVID contracted. Pearson correlations.")

      tab_footnote("Note: Pearson correlations. Trust-Approval r = 0.51, indicating 74% independent variance.")
  }
} else {
  cat("Correlation data not available.\n")
}
```

The moderate correlation between trust and approval (r ≈ 0.51 in Vietnam) indicates substantial shared variance (~26%) but leaves approximately 74% of variance unexplained---suggesting these are related but distinguishable constructs.

## Table C2: Variance Inflation Factors

```{r table-c2}
#| label: tbl-vif
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Variance Inflation Factors for Multivariate Models"

      tab_footnote("Note: VIF < 5.0 indicates acceptable multicollinearity levels. All values are well below threshold.")
  }
} else {
  cat("VIF data not available.\n")
}
```

All VIF values fall well below the conventional threshold of 5.0, indicating that multicollinearity does not threaten our coefficient estimates.

The presence of respondents who trust government information but disapprove of pandemic handling (and vice versa) demonstrates that these are not simply the same construct measured twice.

## C.4 Construct Distinctiveness Summary

Three pieces of evidence support treating information trust and government approval as related but distinct constructs:

1. Moderate correlation: The bivariate correlation (r ≈ 0.51) leaves ~74% of variance unexplained.

2. Off-diagonal responses: A non-trivial percentage of respondents report high trust but low approval (or vice versa), indicating discriminant validity.

3. Acceptable VIF: Multicollinearity diagnostics confirm that including both measures in regression models does not inflate standard errors or bias coefficient estimates.

These diagnostics support our theoretical framework, which posits information trust as a potential *predictor* of approval rather than a mere alternative measure of the same underlying attitude.


# Appendix D: Trust × Infection Interaction Analysis {#sec-appendix-interaction}

Our theoretical framework predicts that information trust should moderate the relationship between negative experiences and approval: infection should reduce approval primarily among respondents who do not trust government information. This appendix presents the full interaction analysis.

## D.1 Theoretical Rationale

The information-credibility heuristic suggests that trusted official narratives provide cognitive frames through which citizens interpret their experiences. When citizens trust government information, they may attribute negative experiences (like infection) to external factors rather than government failure. This predicts a moderation effect: the infection-approval relationship should be more negative among low-trust respondents.

Interpretation: The figure reveals the moderation pattern:

- Thailand (right panel): The lines diverge at low trust levels---infected respondents show lower approval than uninfected when trust is low, but the gap closes at high trust levels. This confirms the information-credibility heuristic.
- Vietnam and Cambodia (left panels): Lines are nearly parallel with minimal gap, reflecting ceiling effects in both trust and approval that leave insufficient variance to detect moderation.

## D.4 Summary of Interaction Findings

The interaction analysis provides partial support for the information-credibility heuristic:

- Thailand shows the clearest moderation pattern: infection reduces approval among low-trust respondents but has no effect among high-trust respondents.

- Vietnam and Cambodia show weaker or non-significant interactions, likely due to ceiling effects---with both trust and approval extremely high, there is limited variance to detect moderation.

These patterns are consistent with the theoretical expectation that information trust buffers the political consequences of negative experiences, though the evidence is stronger in Thailand's more heterogeneous information environment.


# Appendix E: Bivariate Regression Results {#sec-appendix-bivariate}

These tables present the bivariate relationships referenced in the main text.

## Table E1: Personal Infection → Government Approval

```{r table-a1}
#| label: tbl-infection-approval
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Bivariate OLS: COVID-19 Infection and Government Approval"

if (!is.null(h1_results)) {
  tibble(
    Country = names(h1_results),
    β = sapply(h1_results, function(x) x$coef),
    SE = sapply(h1_results, function(x) x$se),
    `p-value` = sapply(h1_results, function(x) x$p),
    `95% CI` = sapply(h1_results, function(x) paste0("[", round(x$ci_lower, 3), ", ", round(x$ci_upper, 3), "]")),
    N = sapply(h1_results, function(x) x$n)
  ) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Effect of Personal COVID-19 Infection on Government Approval",
      subtitle = "Bivariate OLS Regression by Country"
    ) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = c(β, SE), decimals = 3) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = `p-value`, decimals = 4) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = N, decimals = 0) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: DV = Government pandemic handling (1-4 scale). Infection coded 0/1. N varies due to listwise deletion on dependent variable.")
} else {
  cat("Infection results not available.\n")
}
```

Personal infection shows negligible associations with approval in all three countries. The largest effect (Thailand, $\beta$ = -0.072) is substantively trivial---a less than 0.1-point difference on a 4-point scale between infected and uninfected respondents.

## Table E2: Economic Hardship → Government Approval

```{r table-a2}
#| label: tbl-economic-approval
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Bivariate OLS: Economic Hardship and Government Approval"

if (!is.null(h4b_results)) {
  tibble(
    Country = names(h4b_results),
    β = sapply(h4b_results, function(x) x$econ_coef),
    SE = sapply(h4b_results, function(x) x$econ_se),
    `p-value` = sapply(h4b_results, function(x) x$econ_p),
    N = sapply(h4b_results, function(x) x$n)
  ) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Effect of Economic Hardship on Government Approval",
      subtitle = "Bivariate OLS Regression by Country"
    ) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = c(β, SE), decimals = 3) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = `p-value`, decimals = 4) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = N, decimals = 0) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: DV = Government pandemic handling (1-4 scale). Economic hardship = 1-4 severity scale. N varies due to listwise deletion on dependent variable.")
} else {
  cat("Economic results not available.\n")
}
```

Economic hardship effects are inconsistent across countries. Thailand shows the expected negative relationship, Vietnam shows essentially no effect, and Cambodia shows a counterintuitive positive effect.

## Table E3: Trust in COVID Information → Government Approval

```{r table-a3}
#| label: tbl-trust-approval

#| tbl-cap: "Bivariate OLS: Trust in COVID Information and Government Approval"

if (!is.null(h2a_results)) {
  tibble(
    Country = names(h2a_results),
    β = sapply(h2a_results, function(x) x$coef),
    SE = sapply(h2a_results, function(x) x$se),
    `p-value` = sapply(h2a_results, function(x) x$p),
    `R²` = sapply(h2a_results, function(x) x$r_squared),
    N = sapply(h2a_results, function(x) x$n)
  ) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Effect of Trust in COVID Information on Government Approval",
      subtitle = "Bivariate OLS Regression by Country"
    ) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = c(β, SE, `R²`), decimals = 3) %>%
    fmt_scientific(columns = `p-value`, decimals = 2) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = N, decimals = 0) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: DV = Government pandemic handling (1-4 scale). Trust = 1-4 scale. R-squared indicates variance explained by trust alone. N varies due to listwise deletion on dependent variable. Standardized coefficients range from 0.51 to 0.67 across countries, with Vietnam's = 0.51 indicating that even within its compressed high-trust distribution, variation in trust exerts substantial influence on approval.")
} else {
  cat("Trust results not available.\n")
}
```

Trust in government COVID information shows strong, highly significant associations with approval in all three countries. The R² values (0.26-0.45) indicate that trust alone explains 26-45% of variance in approval---a substantial effect.

# Appendix G: Alternative Estimators {#sec-appendix-estimators}

## G.1 Ordinal Logistic Regression

Our main analysis treats the 1-4 government approval scale as continuous using OLS. As a robustness check, we re-estimate all models using cumulative link models (ordered logistic regression) to respect the ordinal nature of the outcome.

```{r table-e1}
#| label: tbl-ordinal
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "OLS vs. Ordinal Logistic Regression: Coefficient Comparison"

if (!is.null(ordinal_comparison)) {
  ordinal_comparison %>%
    mutate(
      `Direction Match` = case_when(
        sign(OLS_Coefficient) == sign(Ordinal_Coefficient) ~ "Yes",
        TRUE ~ "No"
      ),
      `Significance Match` = case_when(
        (OLS_Significant == TRUE & Ordinal_Significant == TRUE) |
        (OLS_Significant == FALSE & Ordinal_Significant == FALSE) ~ "Yes",
        TRUE ~ "No"
      )
    ) %>%
    select(Country, Variable, `OLS β` = OLS_Coefficient, `Ordinal β` = Ordinal_Coefficient,
           `Direction Match`, `Significance Match`) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Robustness Check: OLS vs. Ordinal Logistic",
      subtitle = "Cumulative Link Models Comparison"
    ) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = c(`OLS β`, `Ordinal β`), decimals = 3) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: Ordinal coefficients are log-odds (not directly comparable in magnitude). Key test: direction and significance consistency.") %>%
    format_wide_gt()
} else {
  cat("Ordinal comparison not available.\n")
}
```

All coefficients show the same direction and significance pattern across both estimation approaches. Substantive conclusions are identical regardless of whether we treat the outcome as continuous or ordinal.

## G.2 Robust Regression (M-Estimation)

To ensure results are not driven by outliers, we re-estimate models using robust regression with Huber M-estimation.

```{r table-e2}
#| label: tbl-robust
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "OLS vs. Robust Regression: Trust Coefficients"

if (!is.null(robust_comparison)) {
  bind_rows(
    robust_comparison$vietnam %>% mutate(Country = "Vietnam"),
    robust_comparison$cambodia %>% mutate(Country = "Cambodia"),
    robust_comparison$thailand %>% mutate(Country = "Thailand")
  ) %>%
    select(Country, Variable, OLS, Robust, `Δ%` = Pct_Change) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "OLS vs. Robust Regression Comparison",
      subtitle = "Huber M-Estimation Robustness Check"
    ) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = c(OLS, Robust, `Δ%`), decimals = 3) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: Minimal changes (<5%) indicate results are not substantially influenced by outliers.") %>%
    tab_options(table.font.size = px(9))
} else {
  cat("Robust regression comparison not available.\n")
}
```

## G.3 Quantile Regression

To assess whether trust effects vary across the distribution of government approval, we estimate quantile regressions at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.

```{r table-e3}
#| label: tbl-quantile
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Quantile Regression: Trust Effects Across Approval Distribution"

if (!is.null(quantile_results)) {
  bind_rows(
    quantile_results$vietnam %>% mutate(Country = "Vietnam"),
    quantile_results$cambodia %>% mutate(Country = "Cambodia"),
    quantile_results$thailand %>% mutate(Country = "Thailand")
  ) %>%
    filter(Variable == "Trust in Info") %>%
    select(Country, Q25, Q50, Q75, OLS) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Trust Effects by Quantile",
      subtitle = "Coefficients at 25th, 50th (Median), and 75th Percentiles"
    ) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = c(Q25, Q50, Q75, OLS), decimals = 3) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: Similar coefficients across quantiles indicate consistent effects throughout the approval distribution.")
} else {
  cat("Quantile results not available.\n")
}
```

Trust effects are relatively consistent across the approval distribution, with somewhat larger effects at lower quantiles (i.e., among respondents with lower baseline approval).

# Appendix H: Missing Data Analysis {#sec-appendix-missing}

## Table H1: Missing Data Patterns

```{r table-f1}
#| label: tbl-missing
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Missing Data Patterns by Variable and Country"

if (!is.null(missing_summary)) {
  missing_summary %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Missing Data Summary",
      subtitle = "Percentage Missing by Variable"
    ) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = where(is.numeric), decimals = 1) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: All key variables show <20% missing. Complete case analysis produces identical substantive conclusions.")
} else {
  cat("Missing data summary not available.\n")
}
```

## Table H2: Complete Case Analysis

```{r table-f2}
#| label: tbl-complete-case
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Main Analysis vs. Complete Cases: Coefficient Comparison"

if (!is.null(complete_case_results)) {
  complete_case_results$comparison %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Complete Case Robustness Check",
      subtitle = "Sample Retention and Coefficient Stability"
    ) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = N, decimals = 0) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = Percent_Retained, decimals = 1) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: Complete case restriction retains >75% of sample with substantively identical results.")
} else {
  cat("Complete case results not available.\n")
}
```

Given low rates of item nonresponse (<15% on key variables) and equivalence of complete-case and available-case estimates, listwise deletion is appropriate for our analyses.

# Appendix I: Survey Timing Robustness {#sec-appendix-timing}

## I.1 Temporal Distribution of Data Collection

Data collection timing varied substantially across countries. Table H1 documents the fieldwork periods.

```{r table-timing-distribution}
#| label: tbl-timing-dist
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Survey Fieldwork Timing by Country"

tibble(
  Country = c("Cambodia", "Thailand", "Vietnam"),
  `Primary Fieldwork Period` = c("December 2021", "April-May 2022", "August-September 2022"),
  `% in Primary Period` = c(84.2, 86.5, 97.7),
  `Pandemic Phase` = c("Post-Delta recovery", "Mid-Omicron wave", "Peak Omicron infections"),
  `National Cases (per 100k)` = c("~50", "~150", "~300")
) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Survey Fieldwork Timing",
    subtitle = "Non-overlapping data collection across pandemic phases"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = `% in Primary Period`, decimals = 1) %>%
  tab_footnote("Note: Case rates are approximate weekly averages during primary fieldwork. Vietnam was surveyed during objectively worse conditions yet shows highest approval.")
```

This non-overlapping timing means respondents evaluated governments at different pandemic phases. Critically, Vietnam was surveyed during peak Omicron infections---the worst objective conditions---yet shows the highest approval. This strengthens rather than weakens our core finding.

## I.2 Within-Country Timing Effects

```{r timing-analysis}
#| label: tbl-timing
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Effect of Interview Timing on Government Approval"

if (!is.null(ab_data)) {
  # Test timing effects within each country
  test_timing <- function(country_data, country) {
    n_months <- country_data %>%
      filter(!is.na(month)) %>%
      pull(month) %>%
      unique() %>%
      length()
    
    if (n_months < 2) {
      return(tibble(Country = country, `Timing Effect p` = NA, `ΔR²` = NA, Note = "Insufficient variation"))
    }
    
    baseline <- lm(covid_govt_handling ~ covid_contracted + covid_trust_info + 
                   institutional_trust_index, data = country_data)
    timing <- lm(covid_govt_handling ~ covid_contracted + covid_trust_info + 
                 institutional_trust_index + factor(month), data = country_data)
    
    f_test <- anova(baseline, timing)
    
    tibble(
      Country = country,
      `Timing Effect p` = round(f_test$`Pr(>F)`[2], 3),
      `ΔR²` = round(summary(timing)$r.squared - summary(baseline)$r.squared, 3),
      Note = ifelse(f_test$`Pr(>F)`[2] > 0.05, "Not significant", "Significant")
    )
  }
  
  ab_data %>%
    mutate(country_name = as.character(country_name),
           month = as.numeric(as.vector(month))) %>%
    filter(country_name %in% c("Vietnam", "Cambodia", "Thailand")) %>%
    group_by(country_name) %>%
    group_modify(~test_timing(.x, .y$country_name)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Interview Timing Robustness Check",
      subtitle = "F-Test for Month Effects on Approval"
    ) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: Non-significant timing effects indicate approval is stable across interview periods within each country.")
} else {
  cat("Timing analysis data not available.\n")
}
```

Interview timing effects are generally small or non-significant within countries. Where statistically detectable, they do not substantively alter our main conclusions. This temporal stability---where information environments remained relatively constant even as infection rates varied---is consistent with the interpretation that information trust rather than objective conditions drives approval.

# Appendix J: Outlier Diagnostics {#sec-appendix-outliers}

if (!is.null(outlier_diag)) {
  bind_rows(
    tibble(
      Country = "Vietnam",
      N = nrow(outlier_diag$vietnam),
      `High Cook's D` = sum(outlier_diag$vietnam$high_influence, na.rm = TRUE),

    ),
    tibble(

      `High Cook's D` = sum(outlier_diag$thailand$high_influence, na.rm = TRUE),
      `High Leverage` = sum(outlier_diag$thailand$high_leverage, na.rm = TRUE),
      `Large Residual` = sum(outlier_diag$thailand$outlier, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  ) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Outlier Diagnostics Summary",
      subtitle = "Number of Observations Flagged"
    ) %>%
    fmt_number(columns = where(is.numeric), decimals = 0) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: Thresholds: Cook's D > 4/n; Leverage > 2p/n; |Studentized residual| > 3.")

}
```

    outlier_excluded$thailand %>% mutate(Country = "Thailand")
  ) %>%
    select(Country, Variable, `With Outliers` = Full_Sample,
           `Without Outliers` = Outliers_Excluded, `N Excluded` = N_Excluded, `Δ%` = Pct_Change) %>%
    gt() %>%

    tab_footnote("Note: Minimal coefficient changes indicate results are robust to outlier exclusion.")
} else {

```

Excluding high-influence observations produces substantively similar coefficients, confirming that results are not driven by a small number of unusual cases.

# Appendix K: Media Source Analysis {#sec-appendix-media}

This appendix examines whether our findings hold when accounting for political engagement and primary news sources.

## K.1 Variable Construction

We use two media-related variables from Asian Barometer Wave 6:

- **Political News Frequency (q48):** "How often do you follow news about politics and government?" (1 = Practically never, 5 = Everyday)
- **Primary News Source (q53):** Collapsed into Broadcast (television) vs. Digital (internet/social media)

## K.2 Robustness to News Frequency Control

```{r news-control}
#| label: tbl-news-control
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Trust Effects With and Without News Frequency Control"

news_control_results <- safe_load_rds(file.path(results_dir, "news_frequency_robustness.rds"), "news_control_results")

if (!is.null(news_control_results)) {
  news_control_results %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Trust Coefficient Stability",
      subtitle = "With and Without News Frequency Control"
    ) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: Minimal change in trust coefficient (<10%) indicates results are not driven by political engagement levels.")
} else {
  cat("News frequency robustness results not available. Run analysis/08_news_robustness_check.qmd first.\n")
}
```

The trust coefficient remains virtually unchanged when controlling for news frequency, confirming that the trust-approval association is not an artifact of politically engaged respondents expressing both higher trust and higher approval.

## K.3 News Source Moderation

We also test whether the trust-approval relationship differs between traditional (TV/radio) and digital (internet/social media) news consumers.

```{r news-source-interaction}
#| label: tbl-news-interaction
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Trust × News Source Interaction Effects"

news_interaction_results <- safe_load_rds(file.path(results_dir, "news_source_interaction.rds"), "news_interaction_results")

if (!is.null(news_interaction_results)) {
  news_interaction_results %>%
    rename_with(~ gsub("Traditional", "Trad.", .x)) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Trust × News Source Interaction",
      subtitle = "Does trust effect differ by primary media consumption?"
    ) %>%
    tab_footnote("Note: Trad. = Traditional. Negative interaction = trust effect WEAKER for digital users. p < 0.05 indicates significant moderation.")
} else {
  cat("News source interaction results not available. Run analysis/08_news_robustness_check.qmd first.\n")
}
```

The interaction analysis tests whether information environments (traditional vs. digital media) moderate the trust-approval relationship. A negative interaction coefficient would indicate that the trust-approval relationship is weaker among digital media users compared to traditional media users.

## K.4 Summary

These analyses confirm that our core finding---trust in government COVID information is more strongly associated with approval than personal infection or economic hardship---is robust to available measures of political engagement and media use.

# Appendix L: Sensitivity Analysis {#sec-appendix-sensitivity}

This appendix presents detailed results from sensitivity analyses addressing potential threats to inference: unmeasured confounding, construct validity, missing data bias, and omitted economic variables.

## L.1 E-Value Sensitivity Analysis

The E-value quantifies how strong an unmeasured confounder would need to be---in terms of its associations with both the treatment (information trust) and outcome (approval)---to fully explain away an observed effect [@VanderWeele2017-jh]. A large E-value indicates robustness to unmeasured confounding.

```{r evalue-table}
#| label: tbl-evalue
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "E-Value Sensitivity Analysis for Trust Coefficient"

# Load sensitivity results if available
sensitivity_evalues <- safe_load_rds(file.path(results_dir, "sensitivity_evalues.rds"), "sensitivity_evalues")

if (!is.null(sensitivity_evalues)) {
  sensitivity_evalues %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "E-Value Analysis: Robustness to Unmeasured Confounding",
      subtitle = "How strong must an unmeasured confounder be to nullify the trust effect?"
    ) %>%
    cols_label(
      E_Value = "E-Value (Point)",
      E_Value_CI = "E-Value (CI)",
      Std_Beta = "Std. Beta",
      Approx_RR = "Approx. RR"
    ) %>%
    tab_footnote(
      "E-Value interpretation: An unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with BOTH trust and approval by a risk ratio of at least this magnitude to explain away the observed effect. For reference: smoking-to-lung cancer RR approx 10-20; obesity-to-diabetes RR approx 3-5."
    ) %>%
    format_wide_gt()
} else {
  cat("E-value results not available. Run 09_sensitivity_analysis.qmd first.\n")
}
```

**Interpretation:** E-values range from 2.70 (Vietnam) to 3.71 (Cambodia). An unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both information trust and pandemic approval by a risk ratio of at least 2.7-3.7 to fully explain away our findings. Given that even strong epidemiological associations (e.g., obesity and diabetes, RR ≈ 3-5) rarely exceed this threshold, our findings are robust to plausible unmeasured confounding.

```{r fig-evalue-comparison}
#| label: fig-evalue
#| fig-cap: "E-Value Comparison: Required Confounder Strength vs. Known Epidemiological Benchmarks"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5

# Create comparison data
evalue_comparison <- tibble(
  Association = c(
    "Vietnam (Trust→Approval)",
    "Cambodia (Trust→Approval)",
    "Thailand (Trust→Approval)",
    "Obesity → Diabetes",
    "Smoking → Heart Disease",
    "Smoking → Lung Cancer"
  ),
  E_Value = c(2.70, 3.71, 3.31, 4.0, 3.0, 15.0),
  Type = c("Our Study", "Our Study", "Our Study", 
           "Benchmark", "Benchmark", "Benchmark")
)

ggplot(evalue_comparison, aes(x = reorder(Association, E_Value), y = E_Value, fill = Type)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.7) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 2, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", linewidth = 0.8) +
  annotate("text", x = 0.5, y = 2.3, label = "Robustness threshold (E=2)", 
           hjust = 0, color = "red", size = 3) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Our Study" = "#2166AC", "Benchmark" = "#878787")) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "E-Value (Required Confounder Strength)",
    fill = NULL,
    title = "How Strong Must an Unmeasured Confounder Be?",
    subtitle = "Our findings require confounders as strong as obesity→diabetes to be nullified"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 11) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()
  )
```

The figure shows that nullifying our findings would require an unmeasured confounder with associations comparable to the obesity-diabetes relationship---one of the strongest known epidemiological associations. This is implausibly strong confounding.

## L.2 Falsification Tests: Construct Validity

A methodological concern is that information trust and approval may tap the same underlying construct of regime loyalty. If so, trust should predict all political evaluations equally. We test this by examining whether COVID-specific information trust predicts non-COVID outcomes.

```{r falsification-table}
#| label: tbl-falsification
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Falsification Test: Does COVID Trust Predict Non-COVID Outcomes?"

sensitivity_falsification <- safe_load_rds(file.path(results_dir, "sensitivity_falsification.rds"), "sensitivity_falsification")

if (!is.null(sensitivity_falsification)) {
  sensitivity_falsification %>%
    mutate(
      Trust_Coef = round(Trust_Coef, 3),
      Trust_SE = round(Trust_SE, 3),
      Trust_p = round(Trust_p, 4),
      R2 = round(R2, 3)
    ) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Falsification Test: COVID Trust Specificity",
      subtitle = "Comparing trust coefficients across COVID vs. non-COVID outcomes"
    ) %>%
    tab_footnote(
      "If COVID trust merely proxies regime loyalty, it should predict non-COVID outcomes (democracy satisfaction) as strongly as COVID outcomes. Substantially weaker effects on non-COVID DVs support construct validity."
    ) %>%
    format_wide_gt()
} else {
  cat("Falsification test results not available.\n")
}
```

**Interpretation:** COVID information trust predicts pandemic approval 2-4 times more strongly than democracy satisfaction across all three countries. This pattern supports our interpretation that information trust captures a domain-specific attitude toward pandemic communication rather than diffuse regime support.

```{r fig-falsification}
#| label: fig-falsification

      Trust_Coef = c(
        coef(m_covid)["covid_trust_info"],

      ),

} else {

```

The figure demonstrates that COVID information trust has a substantially larger effect on COVID-specific approval than on general democratic satisfaction. If trust were merely proxying regime loyalty, the bars would be similar heights. The 2-4× difference in effect sizes confirms construct validity.

## L.3 Multiple Imputation (MICE)

We employed Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) to assess whether missing data patterns bias our estimates [@van-Buuren2011-yb]. We created 20 multiply-imputed datasets and pooled results using Rubin's rules.

```{r mice-comparison}
#| label: tbl-mice
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Complete Case vs. Multiple Imputation Estimates"

sensitivity_mice <- safe_load_rds(file.path(results_dir, "sensitivity_mice_comparison.rds"), "sensitivity_mice")

if (!is.null(sensitivity_mice)) {
  sensitivity_mice %>%
    filter(term %in% c("covid_contracted", "covid_trust_info", "covid_impact_severity",
                       "institutional_trust_index", "dem_satisfaction")) %>%
    mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 4))) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Coefficient Comparison: Complete Case vs. MICE",
      subtitle = "m = 20 imputations, Rubin's Rules pooling"
    ) %>%
    tab_spanner(label = "Complete Case", columns = starts_with("CC")) %>%
    tab_spanner(label = "Multiple Imputation", columns = starts_with("MI")) %>%
    cols_label(
      Pct_Change = "Δ%",
      SE_Ratio = "SE Ratio"
    ) %>%
    tab_footnote(
      "SE Ratio > 1 indicates MI captures additional uncertainty from missing data. Δ% < 10% indicates stable coefficients."
    ) %>%
    format_wide_gt()
} else {
  cat("MICE comparison results not available.\n")
}
```

**Interpretation:** Coefficient changes between complete-case and multiple imputation estimates are minimal (<5% for key predictors in Vietnam and Cambodia), indicating that missing data patterns do not meaningfully bias our conclusions.

## L.4 Economic Controls Robustness

A reviewer concern was that the trust coefficient might be "soaking up" the effect of unreported government economic relief or material conditions not captured in our primary economic hardship measure. We address this by adding comprehensive economic controls from the Asian Barometer.

**Additional economic variables:**

- **Income quintile (SE14):** Objective socioeconomic status (1 = lowest, 5 = highest)
- **Income adequacy (SE14a):** "Does your household income cover your needs?" (1-5 scale)
- **Economic anxiety (q161):** "How worried are you about losing your income in the next 12 months?" (1-4 scale)

```{r economic-robustness}
#| label: tbl-economic-robust
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Trust Coefficient Stability with Economic Controls"

sensitivity_economic <- safe_load_rds(file.path(results_dir, "sensitivity_economic_robustness.rds"), "sensitivity_economic")

if (!is.null(sensitivity_economic)) {
  sensitivity_economic %>%
    mutate(
      Trust_Coef = round(Trust_Coef, 3),
      Trust_SE = round(Trust_SE, 3),
      R2 = round(R2, 3)
    ) %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Trust Coefficient with Progressive Economic Controls",
      subtitle = "Does adding income/SES variables attenuate the trust effect?"
    ) %>%
    tab_row_group(label = "Vietnam", rows = Country == "Vietnam") %>%
    tab_row_group(label = "Cambodia", rows = Country == "Cambodia") %>%
    tab_row_group(label = "Thailand", rows = Country == "Thailand") %>%
    tab_footnote(
      "Models: Base = original specification; +Income = adds income quintile; +Adequacy = adds income adequacy; +Full = adds economic anxiety. Stable coefficients across models indicate trust is not proxying for economic conditions."
    ) %>%
    format_wide_gt()
} else {
  cat("Economic robustness results not available.\n")
}
```

**Interpretation:** The trust coefficient remains remarkably stable across all specifications. In Vietnam and Cambodia, adding comprehensive economic controls attenuates the trust coefficient by less than 5%. In Thailand, there is modest attenuation (~16%), but the effect remains substantial and highly significant. These results confirm that information trust is not merely proxying for unreported government economic relief or objective material conditions.

## L.5 Summary

    "ROBUST: Implausibly strong confounding required",
    "PASSED: Trust is domain-specific, not regime loyalty",

  )
) %>%

  tab_header(
    title = "Sensitivity Analysis Summary",
    subtitle = "All four tests support robustness of core findings"
  ) %>%

    Threshold = "Threshold",
    Interpretation = "Conclusion"
  ) %>%

    style = cell_fill(color = "#d4edda"),
    locations = cells_body(columns = Interpretation)
  ) %>%
  tab_options(
    table.font.size = px(9),
    table.width = pct(100)
  ) %>%
  tab_footnote(
    "Note: All tests indicate the trust-approval association is not attributable to methodological artifacts."
  )
```

All four sensitivity analyses support the robustness of our core finding: trust in government COVID-19 information is strongly associated with pandemic approval, and this association is not attributable to unmeasured confounding, construct conflation, missing data bias, or omitted economic variables.

# Appendix M: Democratic Attitudes in Non-Democratic Contexts {#sec-appendix-democracy}

A potential concern is that democratic satisfaction (`dem_satisfaction`) may be a problematic measure in Vietnam and Cambodia, given that neither country is classified as a democracy by standard indices. This appendix demonstrates that citizens in all three countries express similar democratic aspirations, validating the cross-national comparability of this measure.

## Table M1: Democracy Preference Distribution

```{r table-n1}
#| label: tbl-dem-preference
#| tbl-pos: H
#| tbl-cap: "Democracy Preference by Country"

if (!is.null(ab_data)) {
  # Filter to only respondents with valid democracy preference responses
  dem_data <- ab_data %>%
    filter(country_name %in% c("Vietnam", "Cambodia", "Thailand")) %>%
    filter(!is.na(democracy_committed) | !is.na(authoritarian_acceptable) | !is.na(regime_indifferent))

  dem_summary <- dem_data %>%
    group_by(country_name) %>%
    summarise(
      N = n(),
      `Democracy Always (%)` = round(100 * mean(democracy_committed, na.rm = TRUE), 1),
      `Authoritarian OK (%)` = round(100 * mean(authoritarian_acceptable, na.rm = TRUE), 1),
      `Indifferent (%)` = round(100 * mean(regime_indifferent, na.rm = TRUE), 1),
      .groups = "drop"
    )

  dem_summary %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(
      title = "Democracy Preference Distribution",
      subtitle = "Q124: Which statement comes closest to your view?"
    ) %>%
    cols_label(country_name = "Country") %>%
    fmt_number(columns = N, decimals = 0) %>%
    tab_source_note(
      "Response options: (1) Democracy is always preferable to any other kind of government; (2) Under some circumstances, an authoritarian government can be preferable; (3) For people like me, it does not matter what kind of government we have."
    ) %>%
    tab_footnote(
      paste0("Note: N = respondents with valid q124 response. Majorities in all three countries---including Vietnam (",
             dem_summary %>% filter(country_name == "Vietnam") %>% pull(`Democracy Always (%)`),
             "%) and Cambodia (",
             dem_summary %>% filter(country_name == "Cambodia") %>% pull(`Democracy Always (%)`),
             "%)---express committed democratic preferences.")
    )
} else {
  cat("Data not available for democracy preference table.\n")
}
```

## M.1 Interpretation

Despite objective differences in regime type, citizens across all three countries express remarkably similar democratic aspirations:

- **Vietnam (70.6%)**, **Thailand (70.8%)**, and **Cambodia (66.5%)** all show supermajorities stating that democracy is always preferable.
- Acceptance of authoritarian rule is a minority position in all countries (13-19%).
- Regime indifference is similarly low across contexts (10-18%).

This pattern suggests that democratic satisfaction captures citizens' subjective evaluation of system responsiveness rather than assessment of objective regime type. Citizens in authoritarian contexts still evaluate their governments against democratic ideals---responsive, accountable, legitimate---making this measure conceptually valid for cross-regime comparison.
