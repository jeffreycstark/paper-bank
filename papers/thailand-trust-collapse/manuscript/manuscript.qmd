abstract: |
  Thailand underwent the most dramatic institutional trust collapse documented in the Asian Barometer Survey's two-decade history. Using six waves of survey data (2001--2022) across Thailand, the Philippines, and Taiwan---the three countries with complete coverage---we show that Thailand went from the highest to the lowest levels of both government and military trust. Multilevel models with random slopes reveal that Thailand's decline is significantly steeper than its comparators. The critical finding: military trust declined approximately 1.5 times more than government trust, a pattern inconsistent with COVID-19 performance explanations but consistent with the political crisis surrounding the 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests against military-backed governance. We argue that Thailand's case demonstrates how prolonged military involvement in politics can erode the very institutional trust that initially legitimized intervention.

# Introduction

In 2001, Thai respondents to the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS) reported among the highest levels of institutional trust in the region---a `r round(thai_mil_w1, 2)` mean on a four-point scale for the military, and `r round(thai_govt_w1, 2)` for the national government. Two decades later, both figures had collapsed to `r round(thai_mil_w6, 2)` and `r round(thai_govt_w6, 2)`, respectively. No other country in the ABS has undergone a reversal of this magnitude. Thailand went from the most trusting to among the least trusting societies in the survey's coverage, a transformation that unfolded across two coups, a five-year military government, and a generational protest movement.

This paper documents and explains that transformation. Using all six waves of the ABS (2001--2022), we compare Thailand with the Philippines and Taiwan---the only other countries with complete coverage across all waves. The three cases experienced substantial political turbulence during this period, yet their trust trajectories diverged sharply: the Philippines and Taiwan remained broadly stable while Thailand collapsed. This variation provides analytical leverage for distinguishing between competing explanations of trust decline.

The central finding is that Thailand's erosion is institutionally differentiated. Military trust fell `r round(thai_mil_govt_ratio, 1)` times more than government trust---a drop of `r round(thai_mil_drop, 2)` points versus `r round(thai_govt_drop, 2)` points over the full period. This pattern is inconsistent with a COVID-19 performance account, which would predict sharper declines for government trust, since elected officials bore primary responsibility for pandemic governance. It is, however, consistent with a political crisis mechanism centered on the 2020--2021 pro-democracy movement, whose demands explicitly targeted military influence over Thai politics and called for constitutional reform.

We argue that Thailand's trajectory reflects a shift from diffuse to conditional institutional trust. Early in the period, trust was relatively generalized---high across institutions and unresponsive to specific political events. Over time, it became increasingly contingent on perceived legitimacy and responsiveness, with coercive institutions particularly vulnerable when they were seen as political actors rather than neutral arbiters. The military's sustained involvement in governance---through coups, constitution-drafting, and managed elections---gradually transformed it from an institution trusted *despite* its political role into one distrusted *because of* it.

Several features of the empirical analysis strengthen causal inference. Pre-trend models show that Thai military trust was actually *rising* through Wave 4 before reversing sharply in Waves 5--6, ruling out a smooth secular decline and pointing to a discrete political shock. The military-government differential survives controls for economic satisfaction and democracy satisfaction, indicating that performance perceptions do not account for the pattern. Subgroup analyses reveal that the decline is steepest among younger and more educated respondents---demographics that were disproportionately represented in the protest movement---but is present across all demographic groups.

The paper contributes in three ways. First, it provides the most comprehensive documentation to date of Thailand's twenty-year trust trajectory, situated within a comparative framework that highlights its exceptional character. Second, the government-military trust differential offers a discriminating test between performance and political crisis explanations, with the data strongly favoring the latter. Third, the case illustrates a broader paradox of military-politics relations: prolonged military involvement in governance can erode the very institutional trust that initially legitimized intervention, a dynamic with implications for civil-military relations across Southeast Asia and other hybrid regimes where militaries claim roles as guarantors of stability.

The next section reviews competing accounts of institutional trust change and develops a framework suited to Asian contexts. We then describe the data, variables, and analytical strategy. The results section presents descriptive trust trajectories, multilevel models testing the exceptionalism and institutional differentiation hypotheses, and a series of robustness checks. We conclude by discussing implications for the comparative study of trust in democratizing societies.

# Literature Review

## Institutional Trust in Democratizing Asia

Political trust has long been recognized as a critical component of democratic stability and governance quality [@Easton1965-vr; @Norris1999-vq]. Yet the foundations and dynamics of trust differ substantially between established Western democracies and the younger, often hybrid regimes of Asia. Where European and North American research emphasizes declining trust as a product of post-materialist value shifts [@Inglehart1997-gw] or rising critical citizenship [@Norris2011-oc], Asian contexts present different patterns shaped by recent transitions, developmental state legacies, and ongoing regime contestation.

Early work on Asian democratization identified a "satisfaction-support gap": citizens could be dissatisfied with democratic performance while maintaining support for democracy as an ideal [@Shin2007-gm; @Park2009-tb]. This framing treated institutional trust as distinct from regime legitimacy, allowing for the possibility that trust in specific institutions could decline without triggering democratic breakdown. Subsequent ABS-based research has documented substantial cross-national and temporal variation in institutional trust across Asia [@Chu2008-fk; @Chang2013-rx], but few studies have examined *within-country* trajectories across multiple decades or investigated the mechanisms driving differential trust across institution types.

Trust in coercive institutions—militaries, police, and courts—presents particular puzzles in Asian contexts. Unlike in consolidated democracies where coercive institutions are firmly subordinated to civilian control, many Asian countries feature militaries with recent or ongoing political roles [@Croissant2013-jp]. Thailand represents an extreme case: the military has launched thirteen successful coups since 1932 and maintains constitutional privileges that insulate it from full civilian oversight even in electoral periods [@Chambers2013-wk; @Ockey2017-rg]. This creates an ambiguous institutional position where the military can be simultaneously viewed as a guarantor of stability and a threat to democratic governance.

Existing research on Thai politics has documented elite polarization, the urban-rural divide in political preferences, and the military's role in regime instability [@McCargo2009-mv; @Ferrara2015-sm; @Prajak2016-fl]. However, we lack systematic evidence on how mass-level institutional trust has evolved across Thailand's tumultuous political trajectory. The available studies focus on single waves or specific periods [@Malaeb2021-dk], missing the long-term dynamics that our six-wave panel can capture.

## Competing Explanations for Trust Decline

Three theoretical frameworks offer competing accounts of institutional trust change in developing democracies. Each makes distinct predictions about the *pattern* of trust decline across institutions and time.

### Performance Legitimacy and Rally Effects

The dominant framework treats institutional trust as a function of performance [@Hetherington1998-jw; @van_de_Walle2008-xn]. Governments that deliver economic growth, maintain security, and provide effective public services earn trust; those that fail lose it. This perspective predicts that trust should track objective performance indicators—GDP growth, unemployment, crime rates—and that all institutions sharing responsibility for governance should rise or fall together.

A variant of performance theory emphasizes rally-around-the-flag effects during crises [@Mueller1970-kf; @Hetherington2001-cf]. Exogenous shocks—wars, natural disasters, pandemics—can temporarily boost trust in government as citizens prioritize coordination and defer to authority. However, if crisis management fails, trust can collapse even more dramatically than baseline performance accounts would predict [@Esaiasson2021-kh]. 

The COVID-19 pandemic provides a natural test of performance theories. If pandemic response quality drives trust changes, we should observe: (1) government trust declining more than military trust, since governments bore primary responsibility for health policy; (2) trust changes correlating with epidemiological outcomes (deaths, cases) or economic outcomes (unemployment, GDP contraction); and (3) similar patterns across countries with comparable pandemic experiences. We test these predictions directly.

### Political Crisis and Democratic Backsliding

An alternative framework emphasizes political crises and regime conflicts as drivers of trust change [@Torcal2014-qg; @Levi2009-ht]. When institutions become implicated in political struggles—coups, constitutional crises, violent repression—citizens update their beliefs about institutional neutrality and responsiveness. This updating can be *targeted*: trust declines for the specific institutions perceived as violating democratic norms, while other institutions may be insulated or even benefit from contrast effects.

Research on democratic backsliding highlights how institutional trust responds to regime regression [@Bermeo2016-zl; @Waldner2017-nh]. When democracies erode through executive aggrandizement, judicial capture, or military intervention, citizens who value democracy lose trust in the co-opted institutions [@Helmke2017-pq]. Crucially, this erosion is selective rather than generalized: authoritarian-leaning citizens may maintain or increase trust even as democratic supporters defect.

In Thailand's case, the political crisis framework predicts that military trust should decline more than government trust, since the military has been the primary agent of democratic disruption through the 2006 and 2014 coups. The 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests—the largest since 2010—explicitly demanded an end to military influence and constitutional reform. If the protests reflected widespread disillusionment with military-backed governance, we should observe disproportionate erosion of military trust coinciding with or following the protest period.

### Pandemic Governance and the COVID-19 Natural Experiment

The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a new wave of research on crisis governance and institutional trust [@Bol2021-yz; @Esaiasson2021-kh; @Kritzinger2021-im]. Early findings suggest that pandemic responses produced divergent trust trajectories: countries with effective containment and economic support saw trust gains, while those with high death tolls and economic disruption saw trust decline [@Baekgaard2020-nz; @Schraff2021-qc].

However, most pandemic-trust research focuses on Western democracies and examines short-term effects. We lack evidence on whether pandemic shocks produce lasting institutional trust changes in developing contexts, and whether such changes operate through the same performance mechanisms observed in advanced economies. Thailand provides a critical case: the country experienced moderate COVID-19 outcomes (lower per-capita deaths than many Western countries but higher than most Asian peers), allowing us to distinguish pandemic effects from political crisis effects.

The key empirical leverage comes from institutional differentiation. If COVID-19 drove Thailand's trust collapse, government trust should decline more than military trust (since governments managed pandemic response). If the 2020--2021 political crisis drove the collapse, military trust should decline more (since the protests targeted military influence). The data strongly support the latter pattern.

## Thailand's Political Trajectory, 2001--2022

To interpret trust dynamics, we must situate them within Thailand's political timeline. Four periods structure the analysis:

**Period 1 (2001--2005): Thaksin's Populist Consolidation.** Thaksin Shinawatra's election in 2001 marked a shift toward programmatic redistribution and rural mobilization [@Phongpaichit2008-gr]. His Thai Rak Thai party delivered on campaign promises—village development funds, universal healthcare, debt relief—generating high satisfaction among rural and lower-income voters [@Walker2008-lp]. Both government and military trust were elevated during this period, reflecting stability and policy delivery.

**Period 2 (2006--2013): Coups, Counter-Coups, and Polarization.** The 2006 military coup against Thaksin initiated a period of chronic instability [@Chambers2013-wk]. Despite deposing an elected government, the coup enjoyed tacit support from Bangkok elites and middle classes who viewed Thaksin as a threat to traditional power structures [@Prajak2016-fl]. The military-drafted 2007 constitution attempted to constrain elected governments, but pro-Thaksin parties won subsequent elections in 2007 and 2011. Massive street protests by both Yellow Shirts (anti-Thaksin) and Red Shirts (pro-Thaksin) paralyzed Bangkok intermittently, culminating in the military's violent dispersal of Red Shirt protests in 2010 [@Montesano2012-gh].

**Period 3 (2014--2019): Military Government and Managed Transition.** The 2014 coup installed General Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister, leading to five years of direct military rule [@Ockey2017-rg]. The military-drafted 2017 constitution embedded mechanisms for military influence: an appointed Senate with veto power, reserved military budget autonomy, and electoral rules favoring incumbent military-aligned parties [@Dressel2020-bv]. The 2019 elections, though formally returning civilian government, were widely perceived as engineered to preserve Prayuth's premiership through pro-military coalition building [@Chambers2021-tf].

**Period 4 (2020--2022): Youth Protests and Institutional Crisis.** The 2020--2021 protests marked a generational rupture [@Prajak2021-sx]. Unlike previous Red-Yellow polarization, these protests united students, urban youth, and workers around three core demands: (1) dissolving parliament, (2) ending military interference in politics, and (3) reforming the monarchy's political role. The government's response—emergency decrees, arrests of protest leaders, censorship—hardened confrontation [@Naruemon2021-qs]. COVID-19 lockdowns temporarily suppressed protests but intensified economic grievances, particularly among younger urban workers.

This timeline generates clear predictions. If trust dynamics track political events rather than economic performance, we should observe: (1) initial trust declines following the 2006 and 2014 coups, (2) continued erosion during the 2014--2019 military government period, and (3) sharp declines between Wave 5 (2018--2020) and Wave 6 (2020--2022) coinciding with the youth protests. Crucially, military trust should decline more than government trust in this period, since protests explicitly targeted military political influence.

## Hypotheses

We derive five core hypotheses tested in the empirical analysis:

**H1 (Thailand Exceptionalism):** Net of demographics and common temporal shocks, institutional trust declines more sharply in Thailand from Wave 1 to Wave 6 than in the Philippines and Taiwan.

**H2 (Institutional Differentiation):** In Thailand, military trust declines more steeply than government trust, particularly in the Wave 5 to Wave 6 period coinciding with the 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests.

**H3 (Performance Controls):** The government-military trust differential persists when controlling for performance proxies (economic satisfaction, perceptions of government effectiveness).

**H4 (Pre-Trend Check):** Differential trends between Thailand and comparator countries exist in Waves 1--4 (pre-COVID), indicating that the collapse is not solely attributable to pandemic governance failures.

**H5 (Robustness):** The institutional differentiation pattern holds when accounting for demographic composition changes, survey mode effects, and potential selection bias across waves.

# Data and Methods

## Data Source and Sample

We use the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS), a collaborative multi-country program coordinated by the Asian Barometer Project Office at National Taiwan University. The ABS conducts nationally representative face-to-face surveys covering political attitudes, democratic values, and institutional evaluations across East and Southeast Asia. Our analysis draws on all six completed waves:

- Wave 1 (2001--2003)
- Wave 2 (2005--2008)
- Wave 3 (2010--2012)
- Wave 4 (2014--2016)
- Wave 5 (2018--2020)
- Wave 6 (2020--2022)

Three countries—Thailand, the Philippines, and Taiwan—have data in all six waves, providing the longest continuous panel available in the ABS. Our total sample comprises `r format(nrow(d), big.mark = ",")` respondents across `r length(unique(d$wave))` waves and three countries.

```{r sample-table}
d %>%
  group_by(country_name, wave) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = wave, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Sample size by country and wave",
      col.names = c("Country", paste0("W", 1:6)),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

Thailand's sample sizes range from approximately 1,200 to 1,500 respondents per wave, sufficient for precise point estimates and comparable to the Philippines and Taiwan. The ABS employs stratified multi-stage probability sampling within each country, with sampling frames updated for each wave to reflect population changes. Response rates vary by wave and country but generally exceed 60%, comparable to other high-quality face-to-face surveys in Asia.

One important caveat: the ABS is a repeated cross-section rather than a true panel. We observe different individuals at each wave, which means we cannot track individual-level trust trajectories or decompose within-person versus between-person variance. However, the repeated cross-sectional design is well-suited to our research question, which focuses on aggregate trust trends and country-level heterogeneity rather than individual dynamics.

## Dependent Variables: Institutional Trust Measures

Institutional trust is measured using a standard four-point scale. Respondents are asked: "How much trust do you have in [institution]?" with response options coded as:

- 1 = None at all
- 2 = Not very much
- 3 = Quite a lot
- 4 = A great deal

The survey asks about six institutions: national government, parliament, the military, courts, police, and political parties. For our analysis, we focus on two primary contrasts:

1. **National Government Trust** (our measure of elected/administrative institutional trust)
2. **Military Trust** (our measure of coercive institutional trust)

This comparison provides theoretical and empirical leverage for three reasons. First, the government-military contrast maps onto the political crisis framework: if the 2020--2021 protests targeted military influence specifically, we should observe larger declines in military trust. Second, pandemic performance theories predict the opposite pattern: government trust should decline more than military trust, since governments manage health policy. Third, militaries in Southeast Asia occupy ambiguous positions—sometimes viewed as stabilizing forces, sometimes as anti-democratic threats—making their trust dynamics theoretically interesting.

We also examine police and court trust as secondary outcomes to assess whether trust erosion is specific to the military or extends to other coercive institutions. If the mechanism is anti-militarism rather than generalized anti-state sentiment, police and court trust should show different patterns than military trust.

The four-point scale is treated as continuous in our models, following standard practice in institutional trust research [@Marien2011-ms; @van_der_Meer2011-hc]. Robustness checks using ordered logistic regression produce substantively identical results (Online Appendix, Table A2).

## Independent Variables and Controls

Our primary independent variable is **Wave**, coded as an integer from 1 to 6, which captures linear time trends. We also test quadratic specifications ($\text{Wave}^2$) to allow for non-linear trajectories, though visual inspection of Figure 1 suggests primarily linear decline in Thailand's case.

**Country** is coded as a categorical variable with Thailand as the reference category, allowing direct interpretation of Philippines and Taiwan coefficients as deviations from Thailand's trajectory.

We include standard demographic controls to account for compositional changes across waves and between countries:

- **Age** (centered at the grand mean)
- **Female** (binary indicator)
- **Education** (years of schooling, standardized within each wave)
- **Urban** (binary indicator for urban residence)

These controls address two concerns. First, if demographic composition changes substantially across waves—for example, if later waves oversample urban educated respondents—this could bias trust trends. Second, if demographic groups have different baseline trust levels, compositional differences between countries could confound cross-national comparisons. By controlling for demographics, we ensure that trust trajectories reflect within-demographic-group changes rather than composition effects.

We considered but ultimately excluded income and employment status from baseline models due to high missingness (>15% in some waves) and potential endogeneity concerns (economic outcomes may be affected by institutional performance, creating post-treatment bias). Supplementary models including these variables are available in the online appendix.

## Analytical Strategy

### Baseline Multilevel Models

Our core specification employs multilevel (random effects) models with country-specific intercepts and slopes. The baseline model with random intercepts only is:

$$\text{Trust}_{ij} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta} + u_{0j} + \epsilon_{ij}$$

where $i$ indexes individuals, $j$ indexes countries, $\gamma_{00}$ is the overall intercept, $\gamma_{10}$ is the average wave effect (common trend), $\mathbf{X}_{ij}$ contains demographic controls, $u_{0j}$ captures country-specific baseline trust levels, and $\epsilon_{ij}$ is individual-level error.

This model assumes parallel trends: all countries experience the same rate of trust change over time, differing only in their starting levels. To relax this assumption, we estimate a random slopes model:

$$\text{Trust}_{ij} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$$

where $u_{1j}$ allows country-specific deviations from the average time trend. If Thailand's trust decline is unusually steep, $u_{1,\text{Thailand}}$ should be significantly negative and larger in magnitude than $u_{1,\text{Philippines}}$ or $u_{1,\text{Taiwan}}$.

We fit separate models for government trust and military trust, then formally compare country-specific slopes across institutions. A Likelihood Ratio Test assesses whether the random slopes specification significantly improves fit over the random intercepts model.

### Testing Institutional Differentiation

To test H2 (military trust declines more than government trust in Thailand), we estimate a pooled model combining both trust measures:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Trust}_{ijk} = {} & \gamma_{000} + \gamma_{100}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \gamma_{010}\text{Military}_{ijk} + \gamma_{110}\text{Wave} \times \text{Military}_{ij} \\
& + \gamma_{001}\text{Thailand}_j + \gamma_{101}\text{Wave} \times \text{Thailand}_{ij} \\
& + \gamma_{011}\text{Military} \times \text{Thailand}_{ijk} + \gamma_{111}\text{Wave} \times \text{Military} \times \text{Thailand}_{ijk} \\
& + \mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta} + u_{0jk} + \epsilon_{ijk}
\end{aligned}
$$

The three-way interaction term $\gamma_{111}$ tests whether the government-military trust differential changes differently in Thailand versus comparator countries. A negative coefficient indicates that Thailand's military trust declined *more* than its government trust, relative to the patterns observed in the Philippines and Taiwan.

### Pre-COVID Trend Analysis

To address concerns that the observed patterns reflect pre-existing trends rather than the 2020--2021 political crisis, we estimate restricted models using only Waves 1--4 (pre-COVID period). If Thailand was already experiencing steeper military trust declines before the pandemic, this would weaken the causal interpretation linking the 2020--2021 protests to trust erosion.

The pre-trend model takes the form:

$$\text{Trust}_{ij}^{\text{W1-W4}} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$$

We then compare the estimated $u_{1j}$ coefficients from the pre-COVID and full-sample models. If the differential between Thailand and comparators is substantially larger in the full sample, this suggests a discontinuity around Waves 5--6 rather than a smooth continuation of pre-existing trends.

### Robustness Checks

We conduct five sets of robustness checks:

1. **Non-linear specifications**: Test quadratic and cubic time trends to ensure linear specification is not obscuring non-monotonic patterns
2. **Alternative outcome coding**: Estimate ordered logistic regression models treating trust as ordinal categories
3. **Subgroup analysis**: Examine trust trajectories separately by age cohort, education level, and urban/rural residence to assess whether the aggregate patterns reflect shifting composition or uniform declines
4. **Survey mode effects**: Although all ABS waves use face-to-face interviews, we check for potential effects of interviewer training changes or question wording adjustments across waves
5. **Alternative comparison sets**: Re-estimate models including additional Asian Barometer countries with partial wave coverage to assess whether Philippines-Taiwan comparison is representative

## Identifying Assumptions and Limitations

Several assumptions merit explicit discussion:

**Repeated cross-sections versus panel data.** We observe different individuals at each wave, preventing individual-level causal inference. However, our research question concerns aggregate trust trends rather than individual dynamics, making repeated cross-sections appropriate. The large sample sizes provide precise estimates of population means at each wave.

**Selection into survey participation.** If respondents with low institutional trust become less likely to participate over time, our estimates would understate true declines. However, response rates remain stable across waves (60--70%), and ABS sampling protocols include call-back procedures and replacement sampling to minimize selective non-response. Sensitivity analyses applying Heckman-type selection corrections produce substantively identical results.

**Measurement comparability.** The trust questions use identical wording across waves and countries, and the ABS implements standardized translation and back-translation protocols. However, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that "trust" carries different connotations across cultures or that the meaning of "military" changes as the Thai military's political role evolves. The Philippines and Taiwan comparisons help address this concern: if measurement were unstable, we should observe similar patterns across all three countries.

**Ecological inference.** We infer individual-level mechanisms from country-level heterogeneity. For example, we argue that the government-military differential reflects political crisis rather than pandemic performance, but we do not directly observe individual attitudes toward the military's political role. Where possible, we supplement aggregate analyses with subgroup comparisons (e.g., urban vs. rural, younger vs. older cohorts) to strengthen inferences.

**Three-country comparison.** Our N=3 country sample limits statistical power for cross-national comparisons and prevents formal meta-analytic pooling across regions. However, the Philippines and Taiwan provide theoretically meaningful contrasts: both experienced political turbulence (Philippine drug war, Taiwanese cross-strait tensions) yet exhibit stable or modestly changing trust levels. This suggests that political instability per se does not automatically generate Thai-style trust collapse.

Despite these limitations, the combination of six waves, large within-country samples, and theoretically motivated institutional contrasts provides unusually strong evidence for tracking trust dynamics in Thailand. The robustness checks described above further strengthen confidence in our core findings.

# Results

## Trust Trajectories

```{r fig-trajectories, fig.cap="Twenty-year trust trajectories for government (A) and military (B) trust across three countries with complete ABS coverage (Waves 1-6).", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_dir, "fig3_combined_trajectories.png"))
```

Figure 1 displays the twenty-year trust trajectories for government and military trust. Thailand's trajectory is striking: government trust declined from `r round(thai_govt_w1, 2)` in Wave 1 to `r round(thai_govt_w6, 2)` in Wave 6, a drop of `r round(abs(thai_govt_w6 - thai_govt_w1), 2)` points on a four-point scale. Military trust declined even more dramatically, from `r round(thai_mil_w1, 2)` to `r round(thai_mil_w6, 2)`, a drop of `r round(abs(thai_mil_w6 - thai_mil_w1), 2)` points. By contrast, the Philippines and Taiwan show comparatively stable trajectories with modest fluctuations.

Table 2 reports fixed-effects models with country × wave interactions, testing whether Thailand's trust decline is exceptionally steep (H1). With Thailand as the reference category, the `wave_num` coefficient captures Thailand's per-wave trend: government trust declines by `r round(res$h1$thai_govt_slope, 3)` points per wave (*p* < .001), and military trust by `r round(res$h1$thai_mil_slope, 3)` points per wave (*p* < .001). The positive and highly significant interaction terms for both the Philippines ($b$ = `r round(res$h1$phil_govt_interaction$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001 for government; $b$ = `r round(res$h1$phil_mil_interaction$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001 for military) and Taiwan ($b$ = `r round(res$h1$taiwan_govt_interaction$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001 for government; $b$ = `r round(res$h1$taiwan_mil_interaction$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001 for military) confirm that these countries experienced significantly less steep declines. Indeed, the interaction coefficients for the Philippines are large enough to imply a *positive* net slope, indicating rising trust over the period—a pattern we discuss further below.

```{r tab-random-slopes}
# Random slopes comparison
re_combined <- bind_rows(h1_rs_govt$random_effects, h1_rs_mil$random_effects) %>%
  select(country, institution, slope_dev) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = institution, values_from = slope_dev) %>%
  mutate(
    difference = military - government,
    across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3))
  )

re_combined %>%
  kbl(caption = "Country-specific random slope deviations from the average wave trend, estimated from multilevel models with random slopes.",
      col.names = c("Country", "Government", "Military", "Difference"),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

```{r thai-slope-diff, include=FALSE}
thai_slope_diff <- re_combined$difference[re_combined$country == "Thailand"]
```

Multilevel models with random slopes corroborate these findings (Table 3). Thailand's slope deviations are the most negative for both institutions, and the gap between military and government slope deviations is largest for Thailand (`r round(thai_slope_diff, 3)`), consistent with both H1 and H2. A likelihood ratio test confirms that the random-slopes specification significantly improves fit over random intercepts alone (*p* < .001), indicating meaningful cross-country heterogeneity in trust trajectories.

## Institutional Differentiation (H2)

The descriptive evidence already suggests that Thailand's military trust declined more steeply than government trust. Table 2 showed a total twenty-year decline of `r round(abs(thai_mil_w6 - thai_mil_w1), 2)` points for military trust versus `r round(abs(thai_govt_w6 - thai_govt_w1), 2)` points for government trust—a ratio of roughly `r round(abs(thai_mil_w6 - thai_mil_w1) / abs(thai_govt_w6 - thai_govt_w1), 1)` to 1. To test this formally, we estimate a pooled model stacking government and military trust observations with a three-way interaction (Wave × Military × Country).

```{r tab-h2-threeway}
h2_key <- h2_threeway$tidy %>%
  filter(str_detect(term, "is_military|wave_num:")) %>%
  mutate(term = clean_terms(term)) %>%
  select(term, estimate, std.error, p.value) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3)))

h2_key %>%
  kbl(caption = "Three-way interaction model testing institutional differentiation (H2). The dependent variable is trust (government and military stacked); Thailand is the reference country.",
      col.names = c("Term", "Estimate", "SE", "p"),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"))
```

```{r h2-inline}
# Extract key coefficients for inline reporting
h2_wave_mil <- h2_threeway$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num:is_military")
h2_threeway_phil <- h2_threeway$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num:is_military:country_namePhilippines")
h2_threeway_taiwan <- h2_threeway$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num:is_military:country_nameTaiwan")
h2_w5w6_key <- h2_w5w6$tidy %>% filter(term == "is_w5w6:is_military:is_thailand")
```

Table 4 presents the key results. The `wave_num:is_military` interaction ($b$ = `r round(h2_wave_mil$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) shows that across the pooled sample, military trust declines faster than government trust per wave. The critical three-way interactions test whether this military-specific decline is *disproportionately* concentrated in Thailand. The positive coefficients for both the Philippines ($b$ = `r round(h2_threeway_phil$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) and Taiwan ($b$ = `r round(h2_threeway_taiwan$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) confirm that Thailand's military-government differential is significantly larger than in either comparator country, supporting H2.

The W5--W6 acceleration test further sharpens this result. A model interacting a Wave 5--6 indicator with the military and Thailand dummies yields a three-way coefficient of $b$ = `r round(h2_w5w6_key$estimate, 3)` (*p* < .001), indicating that the military-specific trust collapse in Thailand was concentrated in the period coinciding with the 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests. This temporal specificity strengthens the link between political crisis and institutional differentiation.

## Performance Controls (H3)

```{r tab-h3-performance}
h6a_key <- bind_rows(
  h6_perf$govt$tidy %>%
    filter(str_detect(term, "wave_num|econ|democracy")) %>%
    mutate(outcome = "Government Trust"),
  h6_perf$mil$tidy %>%
    filter(str_detect(term, "wave_num|econ|democracy")) %>%
    mutate(outcome = "Military Trust")
) %>%
  mutate(term = clean_terms(term)) %>%
  select(outcome, term, estimate, std.error, p.value) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3)))

h6a_key %>%
  kbl(caption = paste0("Models with performance controls: economic satisfaction and democracy satisfaction added to baseline specification (H3). N = ", format(h6_perf$n_obs, big.mark = ","), "."),
      col.names = c("Outcome", "Term", "Estimate", "SE", "p"),
      escape = FALSE,
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"))
```

```{r h3-inline}
h6a_govt_wave <- h6_perf$govt$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num")
h6a_mil_wave <- h6_perf$mil$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num")
h6a_econ_govt <- h6_perf$govt$tidy %>% filter(term == "econ_national_now")
h6a_demsat_govt <- h6_perf$govt$tidy %>% filter(term == "democracy_satisfaction")
```

If the trust collapse were driven by declining economic conditions or dissatisfaction with democratic governance, controlling for these performance proxies should substantially attenuate the wave × country interactions. Table 5 adds economic satisfaction and democracy satisfaction to the baseline H1 specification. Both performance variables are significant and positively associated with trust, as expected: respondents who evaluate the economy more favorably report higher government trust ($b$ = `r round(h6a_econ_govt$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001), as do those more satisfied with democracy ($b$ = `r round(h6a_demsat_govt$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001).

Crucially, however, the country × wave interaction pattern survives largely intact. Thailand's per-wave decline remains steep for both government trust ($b$ = `r round(h6a_govt_wave$estimate, 3)`) and military trust ($b$ = `r round(h6a_mil_wave$estimate, 3)`), and the interaction terms for the Philippines and Taiwan remain positive and significant. This indicates that Thailand's trust erosion cannot be explained away by declining perceptions of economic or democratic performance, supporting H3.

## Pre-Trend Analysis (H4)

```{r tab-pretrend}
pretrend_key <- bind_rows(
  h6_pretrend$govt$tidy %>%
    filter(str_detect(term, "wave_num|country")) %>%
    mutate(outcome = "Government Trust"),
  h6_pretrend$mil$tidy %>%
    filter(str_detect(term, "wave_num|country")) %>%
    mutate(outcome = "Military Trust")
) %>%
  mutate(term = clean_terms(term)) %>%
  select(outcome, term, estimate, std.error, p.value) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3)))

pretrend_key %>%
  kbl(caption = paste0("Pre-trend check: differential trends in Waves 1--4 (pre-COVID). N = ", format(h6_pretrend$n_obs, big.mark = ","), "."),
      col.names = c("Outcome", "Term", "Estimate", "SE", "p"),
      escape = FALSE,
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"))
```

```{r pretrend-inline}
pre_govt_wave <- h6_pretrend$govt$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num")
pre_mil_wave <- h6_pretrend$mil$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num")
```

To assess whether the full-sample results are driven by post-2019 shocks or reflect longer-running dynamics, we restrict the sample to Waves 1--4 (pre-COVID). Table 6 reveals an instructive asymmetry. For government trust, Thailand was already declining before COVID ($b$ = `r round(pre_govt_wave$estimate, 3)` per wave, *p* < .001), but the slope is roughly half the magnitude of the full-sample estimate (`r round(res$h1$thai_govt_slope, 3)`), indicating substantial acceleration in the later waves. For military trust, the pre-trend is even more revealing: the coefficient is *positive* ($b$ = `r round(pre_mil_wave$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001), meaning Thai military trust was actually *rising* through Wave 4 before collapsing precipitously in Waves 5--6. This reversal is inconsistent with a smooth secular decline and instead points to a discrete shock—consistent with the political crisis surrounding the 2020--2021 protests.

## Robustness (H5)

We conduct several additional robustness checks, reported in full in the Online Appendix.

```{r tab-secondary}
secondary <- h6_secondary$summary %>%
  mutate(
    institution = str_remove(institution, "trust_") %>%
      str_replace_all("_", " ") %>%
      str_to_title(),
    across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3))
  ) %>%
  arrange(thailand_slope)

secondary %>%
  kbl(caption = "Thailand's per-wave trust slope across all six institutions, from the country x wave interaction model.",
      col.names = c("Institution", "Slope", "SE", "p"),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

*Secondary institutions.* Table 7 reports Thailand's per-wave slopes for all six trust measures. The military exhibits by far the steepest decline (`r round(secondary$thailand_slope[1], 3)`), followed by national government (`r round(secondary$thailand_slope[2], 3)`). Courts, police, parliament, and political parties all decline, but at roughly half the rate or less. This gradient—with the military as the clear outlier—is consistent with a political crisis mechanism that specifically targeted the military's role, rather than generalized institutional malaise.

*Ordered logit models.* Treating trust as ordinal rather than continuous produces substantively identical patterns: Thailand's military trust decline is steeper than government trust, and both are steeper than comparator countries (Online Appendix, Table A2).

*Subgroup analyses.* The military-government differential holds across all demographic subgroups—young and old, urban and rural, low and high education—ruling out the possibility that aggregate patterns are driven by compositional change (Online Appendix, Table A3). Notably, younger and more educated respondents show the steepest military trust declines, consistent with the youth-driven character of the 2020--2021 protests.

*Comparator country dynamics.* Country-specific models for the Philippines and Taiwan provide useful contrasts. In the Philippines, military and police trust remain stable or rise slightly during the Duterte period (Waves 4--6), consistent with preference alignment under a leader who endorsed coercive institutions. In Taiwan, military trust shows no significant trend ($b$ = `r round(res$h5$taiwan_mil_slope$estimate, 3)`, *p* = `r round(res$h5$ftest_pvalue, 3)`), consistent with successful depoliticization of the armed forces following democratization. These patterns are detailed in the Online Appendix (Tables A4--A5).

# Discussion

[TODO: Discuss implications]

## Political Crisis vs. Performance Explanations

The government-military trust differential provides strong evidence that Thailand's trust collapse is not primarily a COVID-19 performance story. The 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests—the largest in Thailand since 2010—explicitly targeted the military's political role. Our data show that military trust was the primary casualty, consistent with a political crisis mechanism.

## Implications for Military-Democracy Relations

Thailand's trajectory illustrates a paradox of military intervention: the very institutions that initially command high public trust can see that trust evaporate when they become entangled in political governance. In 2001, Thai military trust was the highest among our comparison countries. Two coups and two decades of political involvement later, it was the lowest.
