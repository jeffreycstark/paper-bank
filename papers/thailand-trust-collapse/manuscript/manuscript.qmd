  This paper documents Thailand's unprecedented institutional trust collapse using six waves of Asian Barometer Survey data (2001--2022), benchmarked against the Philippines and Taiwan. Thailand's decline is institutionally differentiated: military trust fell 2.4 times more than government trust, inconsistent with pandemic performance explanations but consistent with accumulating legitimacy costs of military intervention. The Philippines provides contrast; trust in coercive institutions held steady under Duterte, where violence aligned with mass preferences. We propose democratic expectation updating: exposure to responsive governance under Thaksin raised evaluative thresholds, making each subsequent intervention more costly. Pre-trend analysis confirms military trust was rising before reversing sharply. Attitudinal evidence shows rejection of authoritarian rule rose as institutional trust collapsed. Findings challenge performance-centered accounts and identify preference alignment as critical scope condition.

# Introduction

In 2001, Thai respondents to the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS) reported among the region's highest institutional trust: `r round(thai_mil_w1, 2)` for the military and `r round(thai_govt_w1, 2)` for government on a four-point scale. Wave 1 captured Thailand at unusual optimism following the 1997 "People's Constitution" and Thaksin Shinawatra's delivery on populist pledges [@Phongpaichit2008-wr]. The high baseline reflected *diffuse* trust—default civic confidence rooted in post-crisis renewal rather than performance judgment.

Two decades later, both collapsed to `r round(thai_mil_w6, 2)` and `r round(thai_govt_w6, 2)`. No other ABS country underwent this magnitude reversal. Thailand went from most to least trusting across two coups, five-year military government, and generational protest movement.

This paper documents that transformation using all six ABS waves (2001--2022), comparing Thailand with the Philippines and Taiwan, the only countries with complete coverage. The central finding: Thailand's erosion is institutionally differentiated. Military trust fell `r round(thai_mil_govt_ratio, 1)` times more than government trust, inconsistent with COVID performance accounts but consistent with political crisis mechanisms centered on 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests.

Drawing on Easton's [-@Easton1965-ap; -@Easton1975-bg] diffuse/specific support distinction, we argue Thailand's trajectory reflects structural transformation from diffuse confidence to conditional evaluation. Repeated crises (coups, confrontations, constitutional manipulation) transformed the military from institution trusted *despite* political role to one distrusted *because of* it.

Pre-trend models show Thai military trust *rising* through Wave 4 before reversing in Waves 5--6, ruling out secular decline. Patterns survive economic/democracy satisfaction controls. Declines steepest among younger, educated respondents but present across demographics. The paper contributes by (1) comprehensively documenting Thailand's exceptional trajectory, (2) using institutional differentiation to discriminate explanations, (3) illustrating how prolonged military governance erodes legitimating trust.

# Literature and Theory

## Institutional Trust in Democratizing Asia

Political trust is critical for democratic stability [@Easton1965-ap; @Norris1999-sn], but dynamics differ between established democracies and Asia's hybrid regimes. Western research emphasizes post-materialist shifts [@Inglehart1997-gw] or critical citizenship [@Norris2011-oc]; Asian contexts show different patterns from transitions and regime contestation.

Early work identified "satisfaction-support gap": citizens dissatisfied with performance while maintaining democratic support [@Shin2007-gu]. Research documented substantial trust variation across Asia [@Chu2008-fk], but few examine within-country trajectories across decades or investigate mechanisms driving differential trust.

Trust in coercive institutions presents puzzles. Unlike consolidated democracies with civilian control, many Asian militaries have ongoing political roles [@Croissant2013-ly]. Thailand is extreme: thirteen coups since 1932, constitutional privileges insulating military from oversight [@Chambers2014-ty; @Ockey2017-ux]. Research documents polarization and military's instability role [@McCargo2009-vs; @Ferrara2015-we], but we lack systematic evidence on mass-level trust evolution.

## Competing Explanations and Thailand's Trajectory

**Performance legitimacy** treats trust as performance function [@Hetherington1998-sz; @Van_de_Walle2008-cm]. Rally variants predict temporary crisis gains [@Mueller1970-kf], but collapse if management fails [@Esaiasson2021-vg]. COVID provides a test: if pandemic response drives change, government trust should decline more than military.

**Political crisis** frameworks emphasize regime conflicts [@Torcal2014-xs; @Levi2000-am]. When institutions implicate in struggles (coups, crises), citizens update neutrality beliefs. Updating can be *targeted*: trust declines for norm-violating institutions while others insulated [@Bermeo2016-zl; @Helmke2017-pq].

For Thailand, political crisis predicts military trust should decline more (primary disruptor via 2006/2014 coups). The 2020--2021 protests explicitly demanded ending military interference [@Sinpeng2021-hd].

Thailand's trajectory spans four periods: (1) 2001--2005: post-crisis optimism, Thaksin's populist delivery generated high diffuse trust [@Phongpaichit2008-wr]; (2) 2006--2013: coups and polarization, 2006 coup against Thaksin initiated instability [@Chambers2014-ty]; (3) 2014--2019: military government, five years of direct rule with 2017 constitution embedding military influence [@Ockey2017-ux]; (4) 2020--2022: youth protests and crisis, generational rupture demanding dissolution, ending military interference, reforming monarchy's role [@Sinpeng2021-hd].

## Hypotheses

**H1** (Exceptional decline): Thailand exhibits steeper institutional trust decline than Philippines/Taiwan over 2001--2022.

**H2** (Institutional differentiation): In Thailand, military trust declines more steeply than government trust, consistent with political crisis and inconsistent with pandemic performance.

**H3** (Coercive legitimacy alignment): In Philippines, trust in coercive institutions maintained during Duterte (Waves 4--5), reflecting state coercion-preference alignment.

H3's logic: Where Thailand's military acted against democratic expectations, Duterte's security acted with popular order demand [@Curato2016-kl; @Teehankee2016-xm]. If preference alignment holds, Filipino police trust should remain stable despite extrajudicial killings, providing scope conditions.

**H4** (Democratic expectation updating): In Thailand, rejection of authoritarian rule increases over study period, consistent with rising democratic expectations.

**H5** (Political engagement and trust erosion): Higher political interest associates with lower institutional trust, strengthening over time in Thailand as engagement becomes vehicle for critical evaluation.

H4/H5 test attitudinal mechanisms: democratic expectation updating implies Thailand's collapse reflects deeper evaluative shift, with rising authoritarian rejection alongside trust decline.

# Data and Methods

We analyze all six Asian Barometer Survey waves (2001--2022) for Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan—the only countries with complete coverage. Total sample: `r format(nrow(d), big.mark = ",")` respondents. Trust uses four-point scales (1=none at all, 4=great deal). We focus on government and military trust, with secondary analysis of police, courts, parliament, parties.

```{r sample-table}
d %>%
  group_by(country_name, wave) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = wave, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Sample size by country and wave",
      col.names = c("Country", paste0("W", 1:6)),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

Primary variable: **Wave** (1--6), linear trends. **Country** categorical, Thailand reference. Controls: age, gender, education, urban. Multilevel models with country-specific slopes:

$$\text{Trust}_{ij} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$$

where $u_{1j}$ allows country-specific deviations from average time trend. For H2, pooled models with three-way interactions (Wave × Military × Thailand) test whether Thailand's military-government differential exceeds comparators. Pre-COVID analysis restricts to Waves 1--4, comparing coefficients to distinguish discrete shocks from secular trends. Robustness: non-linear specifications, ordered logit, subgroup analyses.

# Results

## Trust Trajectories and Thailand Exceptionalism (H1)

```{r fig-trajectories, fig.cap="Trust trajectories for government (A) and military (B).", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_dir, "fig3_combined_trajectories.png"))
```

Figure 1 shows trajectories. Thailand's government trust: `r round(thai_govt_w1, 2)` to `r round(thai_govt_w6, 2)` (`r round(thai_govt_drop, 2)` points). Military: `r round(thai_mil_w1, 2)` to `r round(thai_mil_w6, 2)` (`r round(thai_mil_drop, 2)` points). Philippines/Taiwan comparatively stable.

```{r tab-h1-interaction}
h1_key <- bind_rows(
  h1_govt$tidy %>% filter(str_detect(term, "wave_num|country")) %>% mutate(outcome = "Government Trust"),
  h1_mil$tidy %>% filter(str_detect(term, "wave_num|country")) %>% mutate(outcome = "Military Trust")
) %>%
  mutate(term = clean_terms(term)) %>%
  select(outcome, term, estimate, std.error, p.value) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3)))

h1_key %>%
  kbl(caption = "Country × Wave interactions (H1). Thailand reference.",
      col.names = c("Outcome", "Term", "Estimate", "SE", "p"),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"))
```

Table 2 shows Thailand's per-wave decline: government −`r round(abs(res$h1$thai_govt_slope), 3)`, military −`r round(abs(res$h1$thai_mil_slope), 3)` (*p* < .001). Positive Philippines/Taiwan interactions confirm less steep declines.

```{r tab-random-slopes}
re_combined <- bind_rows(h1_rs_govt$random_effects, h1_rs_mil$random_effects) %>%
  select(country, institution, slope_dev) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = institution, values_from = slope_dev) %>%
  mutate(difference = military - government, across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3)))

re_combined %>%
  kbl(caption = "Country-specific random slope deviations.",
      col.names = c("Country", "Government", "Military", "Difference"),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

Multilevel random slopes (Table 3) corroborate: Thailand's deviations most negative, largest military-government gap.

## Institutional Differentiation (H2)

```{r tab-h2-threeway}
h2_key <- h2_threeway$tidy %>%
  filter(str_detect(term, "is_military|wave_num:")) %>%
  mutate(term = clean_terms(term)) %>%
  select(term, estimate, std.error, p.value) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3)))

h2_key %>%
  kbl(caption = "Three-way interaction testing institutional differentiation (H2).",
      col.names = c("Term", "Estimate", "SE", "p"),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"))
```

```{r h2-inline}
h2_wave_mil <- h2_threeway$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num:is_military")
h2_threeway_phil <- h2_threeway$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num:is_military:country_namePhilippines")
h2_w5w6_key <- h2_w5w6$tidy %>% filter(term == "is_w5w6:is_military:is_thailand")
```

Table 4 shows military declines faster than government ($b$ = `r round(h2_wave_mil$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001). Positive three-way for Philippines ($b$ = `r round(h2_threeway_phil$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) and Taiwan confirms Thailand's differential larger, supporting H2. W5--W6 acceleration ($b$ = `r round(h2_w5w6_key$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) indicates military-specific collapse during protests.

## Performance Controls and Pre-Trends

```{r tab-h3-performance}
h6a_key <- bind_rows(
  h6_perf$govt$tidy %>% filter(str_detect(term, "wave_num|econ|democracy")) %>% mutate(outcome = "Government"),
  h6_perf$mil$tidy %>% filter(str_detect(term, "wave_num|econ|democracy")) %>% mutate(outcome = "Military")
) %>%
  mutate(term = clean_terms(term)) %>%
  select(outcome, term, estimate, std.error, p.value) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3)))

h6a_key %>%
  kbl(caption = "Models with performance controls.",
      col.names = c("Outcome", "Term", "Est.", "SE", "p"),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"))
```

```{r h3-inline}
h6a_govt_wave <- h6_perf$govt$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num")
h6a_mil_wave <- h6_perf$mil$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num")
```

Adding economic/democracy satisfaction (Table 5) shows both significant predictors, but country × wave patterns survive, indicating erosion not explained by performance perceptions.

```{r tab-pretrend}
pretrend_key <- bind_rows(
  h6_pretrend$govt$tidy %>% filter(str_detect(term, "wave_num|country")) %>% mutate(outcome = "Government"),
  h6_pretrend$mil$tidy %>% filter(str_detect(term, "wave_num|country")) %>% mutate(outcome = "Military")
) %>%
  mutate(term = clean_terms(term)) %>%
  select(outcome, term, estimate, std.error, p.value) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3)))

pretrend_key %>%
  kbl(caption = "Pre-COVID trends (Waves 1--4).",
      col.names = c("Outcome", "Term", "Est.", "SE", "p"),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"))
```

```{r pretrend-inline}
pre_mil_wave <- h6_pretrend$mil$tidy %>% filter(term == "wave_num")
```

Pre-trend analysis (Table 6) reveals military trust *rising* ($b$ = `r round(pre_mil_wave$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) before Waves 5--6 collapse, ruling out secular decline for discrete shock consistent with 2020--2021 crisis.

## Robustness and Attitudinal Mechanisms

```{r tab-secondary}
secondary <- h6_secondary$summary %>%
  mutate(institution = str_remove(institution, "trust_") %>% str_replace_all("_", " ") %>% str_to_title(),
         across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3))) %>%
  arrange(thailand_slope)

secondary %>%
  kbl(caption = "Thailand's per-wave slopes across institutions.",
      col.names = c("Institution", "Slope", "SE", "p"),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

Secondary institutions (Table 7) show military steepest decline, government second. Police/courts/parliament decline at half rate, confirming crisis targeted military specifically.

**Philippines (H3)**: Military trust rose `r round(phil_mil_w4, 2)` (W4) to `r round(phil_mil_w5, 2)` (W5); police `r round(phil_police_w4, 2)` to `r round(phil_police_w5, 2)`. Despite drug war violence, trust maintained, consistent with preference alignment [@Curato2016-kl].

**Democratic expectations (H4)**: Thai rejection of military rule rose `r round(thai_reject_mil_w1, 2)` (W1) to `r round(thai_reject_mil_w6, 2)` (W6), with strong protest-era rebound ($b$ = `r round(h4_protest_era_b, 3)`, *p* < .001), distinguishing maturation from cynicism.

**Political engagement (H5)**: Political interest associates with lower baseline military trust ($b$ = `r round(h5_mil_main_interest$estimate, 3)`). Positive wave × interest ($b$ = `r round(h5_thai_interest_wave$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) shows less engaged caught up over time.

**Democracy satisfaction**: Satisfaction declined alongside trust but more strongly associates with military than government trust ($b$ = `r round(sat_interaction$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001), indicating politicized military evaluated through democratic performance lens.

### Democratic Commitment and Trust Erosion

To address potential ecological inference concerns, we examine whether military trust erosion concentrates among respondents whose attitudes align with protest movement ideology. While the ABS lacks attitudinal measures of protest support, we can test whether trust decline is steepest among those holding democratic values consistent with the movement's demands.

In Thailand, democratic commitment is strongly associated with lower military trust across all waves ($b$ = `r round(dc_mil_main$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001), indicating that respondents who prioritize democracy and reject authoritarian alternatives consistently evaluate the military more critically. However, the interaction between wave and democratic commitment is positive rather than negative ($b$ = `r round(dc_mil_interact$estimate, 3)`, *p* = `r round(dc_mil_interact$p.value, 3)`), meaning the trust gap between democratic believers and skeptics narrowed over time rather than widened.

This pattern initially appears inconsistent with the hypothesis that democratic true believers drove the trust collapse. However, closer examination reveals a more nuanced dynamic consistent with diffusion of democratic learning. Democratic believers began the period with already-low military trust (reflecting principled opposition to military political involvement), while less ideologically committed citizens extended relatively high diffuse trust. Over two decades, the latter group caught up to the former as repeated military interventions made the costs of military governance increasingly apparent even to initially deferential citizens. By Wave 6, democratic commitment remains the single strongest predictor of military trust ($b$ = `r round(dc_w6_commit$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001), but the effect operates against a universally lower baseline.

Crucially, this pattern differs from government trust. While democratic commitment also predicts lower government trust ($b$ = `r round(dc_govt_main$estimate, 3)`, *p* = `r round(dc_govt_main$p.value, 3)`), and the convergence pattern is even stronger for government (interaction $b$ = `r round(dc_govt_interact$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001), the three-way interaction testing whether democratic commitment operates differently for military versus government trust is not significant ($b$ = `r round(dc_stacked_threeway$estimate, 3)`, *p* = `r round(dc_stacked_threeway$p.value, 3)`). This suggests that democratic believers apply consistently critical standards across institutions rather than specifically targeting the military, though both groups experienced steeper military than government trust declines (wave $\times$ military $b$ = `r round(dc_stacked_wave_mil$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001).

Cross-national comparison reveals that this convergence pattern is specific to Thailand. In the Philippines, the interaction is negative ($b$ = `r round(dc_phil_interact$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001), indicating that democratic believers' military trust gap widened over time relative to democratic skeptics, the opposite of Thailand's pattern. This divergence is consistent with the preference alignment mechanism: under Duterte, Filipinos who valued democracy became increasingly alienated from coercive institutions even as those willing to trade democratic principles for order maintained or increased trust. Taiwan shows no significant difference from Thailand ($b$ = `r round(dc_taiwan_interact$estimate, 3)`, *p* = `r round(dc_taiwan_interact$p.value, 3)`), consistent with stable military depoliticization that neither widens nor narrows ideological trust gaps.

These findings carry two implications for our theoretical framework. First, they confirm that democratic values shape institutional trust evaluations, but the relationship is conditioned by regime trajectory: in contexts of democratic backsliding (Thailand, the Philippines), democratic believers consistently distrust politicized militaries, while in stable democracies (Taiwan), ideology matters less for coercive institutional trust. Second, the convergence pattern in Thailand supports a diffusion interpretation of democratic expectation updating. The 2020--2021 protests were led by democratic true believers who had long been skeptical of military governance, but the protests' broader impact was to extend this skepticism to previously deferential citizens. The aggregate trust collapse thus reflects not only the intensification of existing opposition but its successful transmission to wider publics.

### Regional Variation and Political Geography

Region identifiers available in Waves 4 through 6 allow us to test whether trust erosion concentrated in areas most affected by protest activity and Thaksin-era mobilization. Table 8 displays mean military trust by region across the three waves. Bangkok and the Northeast, the protest movement's urban epicenter and the Red Shirt movement's rural heartland, respectively, experienced virtually identical declines of approximately `r round((reg_bkk_w4 - reg_bkk_w6 + reg_ne_w4 - reg_ne_w6) / 2, 2)` points from Wave 4 to Wave 6. The South, historically a Democrat Party stronghold with lower protest participation, showed the smallest decline at `r round(reg_south_w4 - reg_south_w6, 2)` points, less than half the magnitude of Bangkok and the Northeast.

reg_table <- reg_means %>%
  select(region, wave_num, trust_mil) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = wave_num, values_from = trust_mil,
              names_prefix = "W") %>%
  mutate(
    `Change W4-W6` = W6 - W4,
    `Change W5-W6` = W6 - W5
  ) %>%
  arrange(match(region, c("Bangkok", "Northeast", "Central", "North", "South"))) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 2)))

reg_table %>%
  kbl(caption = "Military trust by region, Waves 4--6. Scale: 1 (none at all) to 4 (a great deal).",
      col.names = c("Region", "W4", "W5", "W6", "Change W4\\textrightarrow W6", "Change W5\\textrightarrow W6"),
      booktabs = TRUE, escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position")) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9)
```

The temporal pattern is particularly revealing. In Wave 5 (2018--2020, immediately following the 2014 coup and military government period), Bangkok, Northeast, and North regions all showed rising military trust relative to Wave 4, consistent with short-term rally effects following the coup. The collapse occurred between Waves 5 and 6 (2020--2022), coinciding precisely with the 2020--2021 protest period. Bangkok dropped `r round(reg_bkk_w5 - reg_bkk_w6, 2)` points from Wave 5 to Wave 6, while the Northeast dropped `r round(reg_ne_w5 - reg_ne_w6, 2)` points, the steepest declines in the survey.

This geographic pattern carries theoretical significance. The convergence of Bangkok (urban, educated, protest movement base) and Northeast (rural, Thaksin loyalist, Red Shirt base) demonstrates that the trust collapse transcended the traditional Red Shirt--Yellow Shirt divide that structured Thai politics from 2006 to 2014. The 2020--2021 protests united constituencies that had previously opposed each other, creating a broader coalition against military governance that encompassed both the pro-democracy youth movement and the rural populist base alienated by repeated coups against elected Thaksin-aligned governments. The South's resilience, by contrast, suggests that regions with weaker histories of anti-military mobilization and stronger conservative-royalist orientation maintained relatively higher (though still declining) trust.

Regression analysis confirms these descriptive patterns. With the South as reference category, both Bangkok ($b$ = `r round(reg_bkk_vs_south$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) and the Northeast ($b$ = `r round(reg_ne_vs_south$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) show significantly steeper trust declines per wave, while the Central ($b$ = `r round(reg_central_vs_south$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) and North ($b$ = `r round(reg_north_vs_south$estimate, 3)`, *p* < .001) regions show intermediate patterns. The geographic concentration of trust erosion in precisely the regions most affected by two decades of political struggle, Bangkok as the site of street confrontations and the Northeast as the electoral base repeatedly disenfranchised by military intervention, strengthens the political crisis interpretation over pandemic performance accounts, which would predict more uniform geographic patterns.

# Discussion

Three findings emerge: (1) Thailand's steepest ABS decline, distinguishable from comparators; (2) institutionally differentiated, military ~`r round(thai_mil_govt_ratio, 1)`× government, concentrated Wave 5--6; (3) survives performance controls, not attributable to pre-trends (military rising Wave 4).

The differential discriminates explanations. Performance theories predict government decline more (manage pandemic/economy). Data reject: military declined more, differential widened Wave 5--6. Performance controls leave patterns intact. Political crisis accounts straightforwardly: protests explicitly demanded ending military interference [@Sinpeng2021-hd]. Military trust collapsed precisely then, steepest among younger/educated. Pre-trend strengthens: military *rising* Wave 4 before reversing, pointing to discrete shock.

Thailand illustrates paradox: prolonged governance erodes legitimating trust. The 2001 baseline reflected diffuse confidence from post-crisis optimism, not considered assessment. Each intervention drew down reserves without replenishing. By 2020--2021, military was explicit mobilization target.

Comparative evidence reinforces. Taiwan's military shows no trend, consistent with depoliticization [@Croissant2013-ly]. Philippines' coercive trust stable under Duterte, reflecting preference alignment [@Curato2016-kl]. Thailand suggests such alignment is fragile.

The February 2026 election following Cambodia conflict provides real-time validation. Results confirm predictions while revealing complexity. Nationalist-conservative Bhumjaithai won plurality (193 seats) from older/rural voters, precisely predicted demographics. Abhisit's Democrats (22 seats, 11.10% party-list) drew younger/urban/educated seeking "clean governance" in explicit *opposition* to conservative coalition.

This pattern initially appears inconsistent with younger/educated driving steepest declines. However, closer examination confirms rather than contradicts democratic expectation updating. Younger voters didn't rally to military nationalism (captured by Bhumjaithai among older voters) but sought institutional change through different pathways. "Liberal-royalist" voters rejected both military-backed bloc and radical reforms, positioning Democrats as opposition force acknowledging failures while advocating moderate reform. No major constituency rallied to defend military-backed status quo.

The 2026 outcome reveals not reversal but *fragmentation* of democratic learning. Older/rural rallied to nationalist appeals; younger voters divided over reform scope (radical vs. incremental). This fragmentation confirms elevated evaluative standards are structural, not cyclical. Even Bhumjaithai's appeal rested on populist economics and cultural conservatism rather than explicit military endorsement.

Attitudinal mechanisms strengthen theory. Rising authoritarian rejection alongside declining trust distinguishes maturation from cynicism. Politically engaged drove decline, connecting to democratic learning research [@Shin2005-wd]. Contribution demonstrates learning generates institutionally differentiated outcomes: targeting norm-violating institutions.

Findings challenge assumptions that Asian trust is primarily performance-driven [@Shin2007-gu]. Political legitimacy concerns can override performance evaluations. Institutional differentiation underscores disaggregation importance: the differential carries theoretical information lost in aggregation. Declining trust isn't inherently problematic; if military trust erodes from rejecting military politics, may reflect democratic deepening.

**Limitations**: Repeated cross-sections prevent individual-level causal inference. Three-country comparison limits generalizability. We rely on ecological inference linking aggregate patterns to mechanisms. Four-point scale has limited granularity. Future ABS waves will determine whether collapse translates into sustained opposition or fragments into competing reform visions.

# Conclusion

Thailand underwent ABS's most dramatic collapse. Between 2001-2022, it reversed from most to least trusting, unparalleled in ABS data. Three findings anchor: (1) decline not artifact but statistically steeper than comparators across specifications; (2) institutionally differentiated favoring political crisis over performance; (3) military-government differential reveals intervention depletes legitimacy.

The differential was key discriminant. Military fell ~`r round(thai_mil_govt_ratio, 1)`× government, concentrated during protests, opposite pandemic predictions. Pre-trend showed military rising before sharp reversal, ruling out secular decline for discrete shock.

Thailand reveals how short-term legitimacy gains produce long-term damage. Each coup/governance year transformed military from neutral arbiter to partisan actor with identifiable preferences and constitutional privileges. By 2020-2021, military was explicit target of mass mobilization. Across Southeast Asia where militaries claim stabilizing roles (Myanmar, Egypt, Pakistan), Thailand offers cautionary illustration.

Findings carry methodological lessons. Disaggregating institutional trust reveals patterns composites conceal; the government-military differential was invisible in aggregate indices. Pre-trend analysis demonstrates long time series value for causal inference; without Wave 1--4 baseline, Wave 5--6 collapse couldn't be distinguished from secular trend.

Declining trust requires interpretive nuance. Often treated as problematic (democratic erosion, governance failure), Thailand suggests more complex reading. If military trust erodes because citizens reject military involvement in democratic politics, may reflect growing democratic expectations rather than decay. The challenge distinguishes erosion undermining governance from erosion accompanying maturation. The twenty-year trajectory is consistent with both readings; resolving this requires attention to how collapse translates into institutional reform ahead.
