  Thailand underwent the most dramatic institutional trust collapse documented in the Asian Barometer Survey's two-decade history. Using six waves of survey data (2001--2022) across Thailand, the Philippines, and Taiwan---the three countries with complete coverage---we show that Thailand went from the highest to the lowest levels of both government and military trust. Multilevel models with random slopes reveal that Thailand's decline is significantly steeper than its comparators. The critical finding: military trust declined approximately 1.5 times more than government trust, a pattern inconsistent with COVID-19 performance explanations but consistent with the political crisis surrounding the 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests against military-backed governance. We argue that Thailand's case demonstrates how prolonged military involvement in politics can erode the very institutional trust that initially legitimized intervention.

# Introduction

Thailand presents a striking puzzle for research on institutional trust in Asia. In the early 2000s, Thai respondents reported exceptionally high confidence in both elected government and coercive institutions. By 2022, Thailand registers among the lowest trust levels in the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS), representing a reversal unmatched by most regional peers.

This paper documents and interprets Thailand's two-decade trust erosion using six waves of ABS data (2001–2022). We adopt a comparative benchmarking design, focusing on Thailand alongside the Philippines and Taiwan—the only other countries with complete Wave 1 through Wave 6 coverage. This comparison is useful not because the cases are identical, but because all three experienced political turbulence while exhibiting sharply different trust trajectories.

Our central empirical result is that Thailand's decline is institutionally differentiated. Rather than government trust collapsing more than military trust—as a pure performance account would predict during periods of economic disruption or pandemic governance—we observe the opposite pattern: trust in the military declines substantially more than trust in government. This divergence motivates a theoretical shift away from explanations that treat trust as a simple referendum on crisis management.

The magnitude of Thailand's reversal is historically unprecedented in the ABS data. Government trust declined from `r round(thai_govt_w1, 2)` in 2001 to `r round(thai_govt_w6, 2)` in 2022, while military trust fell even more dramatically from `r round(thai_mil_w1, 2)` to `r round(thai_mil_w6, 2)`. To put this in perspective, Thailand moved from having the *highest* military trust among all ABS countries in the early 2000s to among the *lowest* two decades later. No other country in the ABS exhibits such a complete institutional trust reversal.

We argue that Thailand's trajectory is better understood as a shift from **diffuse** to **conditional** institutional trust. In the early period, institutional trust appears relatively generalized and unresponsive to specific political events or performance failures. Over time, however, trust becomes increasingly contingent on two factors: (i) perceived procedural legitimacy—whether rules are stable, fair, and impartially enforced—and (ii) perceived political responsiveness—whether institutions listen to and govern in the public interest rather than serve narrow elite interests. In contexts where a coercive institution is widely perceived as politically interventionist, legitimacy and responsiveness concerns can generate targeted erosion even when state capacity and basic governance functions remain intact.

The pattern of decline is inconsistent with explanations centered on COVID-19 pandemic performance or broader economic shocks. If pandemic management failures drove the collapse, we would expect government trust to decline more sharply than military trust, since governments bore primary responsibility for public health responses and economic relief measures. Instead, we find the opposite: military trust declined roughly `r round(abs(thai_mil_w6 - thai_mil_w1) / abs(thai_govt_w6 - thai_govt_w1), 1)` times more than government trust. This institutional differentiation points to the political crisis surrounding the 2020--2021 pro-democracy movement as the primary mechanism—a movement whose central demands explicitly targeted military influence over Thai politics and monarchy reform.

The paper makes three key contributions. First, we provide the first comprehensive documentation of Thailand's full twenty-year trust trajectory, situating it within a comparative framework that highlights its exceptional nature. Second, we demonstrate that the government-military trust differential provides strong evidence for a political crisis mechanism rather than a generalized performance failure. Third, we show that this pattern holds even when controlling for pre-COVID trends, demographic composition, and potential survey artifacts, strengthening causal inference about the role of the 2020--2021 protests.

Beyond Thailand specifically, this case offers broader theoretical lessons about institutional trust in hybrid regimes. The military-democracy paradox we identify—whereby prolonged military involvement in politics erodes the very institutional trust that initially legitimized intervention—suggests that coercive institutions face particular vulnerabilities when they cross the line from guarantor to participant in political competition. This has implications for understanding civil-military relations across Southeast Asia and beyond, where militaries often justify political roles through claims of being "above politics" or serving as neutral arbiters.

We proceed as follows. The next section reviews competing accounts of trust change and develops a conditional-trust framework tailored to the ABS institutional trust measures. We then describe our data, outcome variables, and analytical strategy. The results section first presents descriptive trust trajectories by institution and country, then estimates multilevel models testing whether Thailand's decline is unusually steep and whether the government-military differential holds when accounting for common shocks and pre-existing trends. We conclude by discussing implications for civil-military relations and for the comparative study of institutional trust in developing democracies.

# Literature Review

## Institutional Trust in Democratizing Asia

Political trust has long been recognized as a critical component of democratic stability and governance quality [@Easton1965-vr; @Norris1999-vq]. Yet the foundations and dynamics of trust differ substantially between established Western democracies and the younger, often hybrid regimes of Asia. Where European and North American research emphasizes declining trust as a product of post-materialist value shifts [@Inglehart1997-gw] or rising critical citizenship [@Norris2011-oc], Asian contexts present different patterns shaped by recent transitions, developmental state legacies, and ongoing regime contestation.

Early work on Asian democratization identified a "satisfaction-support gap": citizens could be dissatisfied with democratic performance while maintaining support for democracy as an ideal [@Shin2007-gm; @Park2009-tb]. This framing treated institutional trust as distinct from regime legitimacy, allowing for the possibility that trust in specific institutions could decline without triggering democratic breakdown. Subsequent ABS-based research has documented substantial cross-national and temporal variation in institutional trust across Asia [@Chu2008-fk; @Chang2013-rx], but few studies have examined *within-country* trajectories across multiple decades or investigated the mechanisms driving differential trust across institution types.

Trust in coercive institutions—militaries, police, and courts—presents particular puzzles in Asian contexts. Unlike in consolidated democracies where coercive institutions are firmly subordinated to civilian control, many Asian countries feature militaries with recent or ongoing political roles [@Croissant2013-jp]. Thailand represents an extreme case: the military has launched thirteen successful coups since 1932 and maintains constitutional privileges that insulate it from full civilian oversight even in electoral periods [@Chambers2013-wk; @Ockey2017-rg]. This creates an ambiguous institutional position where the military can be simultaneously viewed as a guarantor of stability and a threat to democratic governance.

Existing research on Thai politics has documented elite polarization, the urban-rural divide in political preferences, and the military's role in regime instability [@McCargo2009-mv; @Ferrara2015-sm; @Prajak2016-fl]. However, we lack systematic evidence on how mass-level institutional trust has evolved across Thailand's tumultuous political trajectory. The available studies focus on single waves or specific periods [@Malaeb2021-dk], missing the long-term dynamics that our six-wave panel can capture.

## Competing Explanations for Trust Decline

Three theoretical frameworks offer competing accounts of institutional trust change in developing democracies. Each makes distinct predictions about the *pattern* of trust decline across institutions and time.

### Performance Legitimacy and Rally Effects

The dominant framework treats institutional trust as a function of performance [@Hetherington1998-jw; @van_de_Walle2008-xn]. Governments that deliver economic growth, maintain security, and provide effective public services earn trust; those that fail lose it. This perspective predicts that trust should track objective performance indicators—GDP growth, unemployment, crime rates—and that all institutions sharing responsibility for governance should rise or fall together.

A variant of performance theory emphasizes rally-around-the-flag effects during crises [@Mueller1970-kf; @Hetherington2001-cf]. Exogenous shocks—wars, natural disasters, pandemics—can temporarily boost trust in government as citizens prioritize coordination and defer to authority. However, if crisis management fails, trust can collapse even more dramatically than baseline performance accounts would predict [@Esaiasson2021-kh]. 

The COVID-19 pandemic provides a natural test of performance theories. If pandemic response quality drives trust changes, we should observe: (1) government trust declining more than military trust, since governments bore primary responsibility for health policy; (2) trust changes correlating with epidemiological outcomes (deaths, cases) or economic outcomes (unemployment, GDP contraction); and (3) similar patterns across countries with comparable pandemic experiences. We test these predictions directly.

### Political Crisis and Democratic Backsliding

An alternative framework emphasizes political crises and regime conflicts as drivers of trust change [@Torcal2014-qg; @Levi2009-ht]. When institutions become implicated in political struggles—coups, constitutional crises, violent repression—citizens update their beliefs about institutional neutrality and responsiveness. This updating can be *targeted*: trust declines for the specific institutions perceived as violating democratic norms, while other institutions may be insulated or even benefit from contrast effects.

Research on democratic backsliding highlights how institutional trust responds to regime regression [@Bermeo2016-zl; @Waldner2017-nh]. When democracies erode through executive aggrandizement, judicial capture, or military intervention, citizens who value democracy lose trust in the co-opted institutions [@Helmke2017-pq]. Crucially, this erosion is selective rather than generalized: authoritarian-leaning citizens may maintain or increase trust even as democratic supporters defect.

In Thailand's case, the political crisis framework predicts that military trust should decline more than government trust, since the military has been the primary agent of democratic disruption through the 2006 and 2014 coups. The 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests—the largest since 2010—explicitly demanded an end to military influence and constitutional reform. If the protests reflected widespread disillusionment with military-backed governance, we should observe disproportionate erosion of military trust coinciding with or following the protest period.

### Pandemic Governance and the COVID-19 Natural Experiment

The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a new wave of research on crisis governance and institutional trust [@Bol2021-yz; @Esaiasson2021-kh; @Kritzinger2021-im]. Early findings suggest that pandemic responses produced divergent trust trajectories: countries with effective containment and economic support saw trust gains, while those with high death tolls and economic disruption saw trust decline [@Baekgaard2020-nz; @Schraff2021-qc].

However, most pandemic-trust research focuses on Western democracies and examines short-term effects. We lack evidence on whether pandemic shocks produce lasting institutional trust changes in developing contexts, and whether such changes operate through the same performance mechanisms observed in advanced economies. Thailand provides a critical case: the country experienced moderate COVID-19 outcomes (lower per-capita deaths than many Western countries but higher than most Asian peers), allowing us to distinguish pandemic effects from political crisis effects.

The key empirical leverage comes from institutional differentiation. If COVID-19 drove Thailand's trust collapse, government trust should decline more than military trust (since governments managed pandemic response). If the 2020--2021 political crisis drove the collapse, military trust should decline more (since the protests targeted military influence). The data strongly support the latter pattern.

## Thailand's Political Trajectory, 2001--2022

To interpret trust dynamics, we must situate them within Thailand's political timeline. Four periods structure the analysis:

**Period 1 (2001--2005): Thaksin's Populist Consolidation.** Thaksin Shinawatra's election in 2001 marked a shift toward programmatic redistribution and rural mobilization [@Phongpaichit2008-gr]. His Thai Rak Thai party delivered on campaign promises—village development funds, universal healthcare, debt relief—generating high satisfaction among rural and lower-income voters [@Walker2008-lp]. Both government and military trust were elevated during this period, reflecting stability and policy delivery.

**Period 2 (2006--2013): Coups, Counter-Coups, and Polarization.** The 2006 military coup against Thaksin initiated a period of chronic instability [@Chambers2013-wk]. Despite deposing an elected government, the coup enjoyed tacit support from Bangkok elites and middle classes who viewed Thaksin as a threat to traditional power structures [@Prajak2016-fl]. The military-drafted 2007 constitution attempted to constrain elected governments, but pro-Thaksin parties won subsequent elections in 2007 and 2011. Massive street protests by both Yellow Shirts (anti-Thaksin) and Red Shirts (pro-Thaksin) paralyzed Bangkok intermittently, culminating in the military's violent dispersal of Red Shirt protests in 2010 [@Montesano2012-gh].

**Period 3 (2014--2019): Military Government and Managed Transition.** The 2014 coup installed General Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister, leading to five years of direct military rule [@Ockey2017-rg]. The military-drafted 2017 constitution embedded mechanisms for military influence: an appointed Senate with veto power, reserved military budget autonomy, and electoral rules favoring incumbent military-aligned parties [@Dressel2020-bv]. The 2019 elections, though formally returning civilian government, were widely perceived as engineered to preserve Prayuth's premiership through pro-military coalition building [@Chambers2021-tf].

**Period 4 (2020--2022): Youth Protests and Institutional Crisis.** The 2020--2021 protests marked a generational rupture [@Prajak2021-sx]. Unlike previous Red-Yellow polarization, these protests united students, urban youth, and workers around three core demands: (1) dissolving parliament, (2) ending military interference in politics, and (3) reforming the monarchy's political role. The government's response—emergency decrees, arrests of protest leaders, censorship—hardened confrontation [@Naruemon2021-qs]. COVID-19 lockdowns temporarily suppressed protests but intensified economic grievances, particularly among younger urban workers.

This timeline generates clear predictions. If trust dynamics track political events rather than economic performance, we should observe: (1) initial trust declines following the 2006 and 2014 coups, (2) continued erosion during the 2014--2019 military government period, and (3) sharp declines between Wave 5 (2018--2020) and Wave 6 (2020--2022) coinciding with the youth protests. Crucially, military trust should decline more than government trust in this period, since protests explicitly targeted military political influence.

## Hypotheses

We derive five core hypotheses tested in the empirical analysis:

**H1 (Thailand Exceptionalism):** Net of demographics and common temporal shocks, institutional trust declines more sharply in Thailand from Wave 1 to Wave 6 than in the Philippines and Taiwan.

**H2 (Institutional Differentiation):** In Thailand, military trust declines more steeply than government trust, particularly in the Wave 5 to Wave 6 period coinciding with the 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests.

**H3 (Performance Controls):** The government-military trust differential persists when controlling for performance proxies (economic satisfaction, perceptions of government effectiveness).

**H4 (Pre-Trend Check):** Differential trends between Thailand and comparator countries exist in Waves 1--4 (pre-COVID), indicating that the collapse is not solely attributable to pandemic governance failures.

**H5 (Robustness):** The institutional differentiation pattern holds when accounting for demographic composition changes, survey mode effects, and potential selection bias across waves.

# Data and Methods

## Data Source and Sample

We use the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS), a collaborative multi-country program coordinated by the Asian Barometer Project Office at National Taiwan University. The ABS conducts nationally representative face-to-face surveys covering political attitudes, democratic values, and institutional evaluations across East and Southeast Asia. Our analysis draws on all six completed waves:

- Wave 1 (2001--2003)
- Wave 2 (2005--2008)  
- Wave 3 (2010--2012)
- Wave 4 (2014--2016)
- Wave 5 (2018--2020)
- Wave 6 (2020--2022)

Three countries—Thailand, the Philippines, and Taiwan—have data in all six waves, providing the longest continuous panel available in the ABS. Our total sample comprises `r format(nrow(d), big.mark = ",")` respondents across `r length(unique(d$wave))` waves and three countries.

```{r sample-table}
d %>%
  group_by(country_name, wave) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = wave, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Sample size by country and wave",
      col.names = c("Country", paste0("W", 1:6)),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

Thailand's sample sizes range from approximately 1,200 to 1,500 respondents per wave, sufficient for precise point estimates and comparable to the Philippines and Taiwan. The ABS employs stratified multi-stage probability sampling within each country, with sampling frames updated for each wave to reflect population changes. Response rates vary by wave and country but generally exceed 60%, comparable to other high-quality face-to-face surveys in Asia.

One important caveat: the ABS is a repeated cross-section rather than a true panel. We observe different individuals at each wave, which means we cannot track individual-level trust trajectories or decompose within-person versus between-person variance. However, the repeated cross-sectional design is well-suited to our research question, which focuses on aggregate trust trends and country-level heterogeneity rather than individual dynamics.

## Dependent Variables: Institutional Trust Measures

Institutional trust is measured using a standard four-point scale. Respondents are asked: "How much trust do you have in [institution]?" with response options coded as:

- 1 = None at all
- 2 = Not very much  
- 3 = Quite a lot
- 4 = A great deal

The survey asks about six institutions: national government, parliament, the military, courts, police, and political parties. For our analysis, we focus on two primary contrasts:

1. **National Government Trust** (our measure of elected/administrative institutional trust)
2. **Military Trust** (our measure of coercive institutional trust)

This comparison provides theoretical and empirical leverage for three reasons. First, the government-military contrast maps onto the political crisis framework: if the 2020--2021 protests targeted military influence specifically, we should observe larger declines in military trust. Second, pandemic performance theories predict the opposite pattern: government trust should decline more than military trust, since governments manage health policy. Third, militaries in Southeast Asia occupy ambiguous positions—sometimes viewed as stabilizing forces, sometimes as anti-democratic threats—making their trust dynamics theoretically interesting.

We also examine police and court trust as secondary outcomes to assess whether trust erosion is specific to the military or extends to other coercive institutions. If the mechanism is anti-militarism rather than generalized anti-state sentiment, police and court trust should show different patterns than military trust.

The four-point scale is treated as continuous in our models, following standard practice in institutional trust research [@Marien2011-ms; @van_der_Meer2011-hc]. Robustness checks using ordered logistic regression produce substantively identical results (available upon request).

## Independent Variables and Controls

Our primary independent variable is **Wave**, coded as an integer from 1 to 6, which captures linear time trends. We also test quadratic specifications ($\text{Wave}^2$) to allow for non-linear trajectories, though visual inspection of Figure 1 suggests primarily linear decline in Thailand's case.

**Country** is coded as a categorical variable with Thailand as the reference category, allowing direct interpretation of Philippines and Taiwan coefficients as deviations from Thailand's trajectory.

We include standard demographic controls to account for compositional changes across waves and between countries:

- **Age** (centered at the grand mean)
- **Female** (binary indicator)
- **Education** (years of schooling, standardized within each wave)
- **Urban** (binary indicator for urban residence)

These controls address two concerns. First, if demographic composition changes substantially across waves—for example, if later waves oversample urban educated respondents—this could bias trust trends. Second, if demographic groups have different baseline trust levels, compositional differences between countries could confound cross-national comparisons. By controlling for demographics, we ensure that trust trajectories reflect within-demographic-group changes rather than composition effects.

We considered but ultimately excluded income and employment status from baseline models due to high missingness (>15% in some waves) and potential endogeneity concerns (economic outcomes may be affected by institutional performance, creating post-treatment bias). Supplementary models including these variables are available in the online appendix.

## Analytical Strategy

### Baseline Multilevel Models

Our core specification employs multilevel (random effects) models with country-specific intercepts and slopes. The baseline model with random intercepts only is:

$$\text{Trust}_{ij} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta} + u_{0j} + \epsilon_{ij}$$

where $i$ indexes individuals, $j$ indexes countries, $\gamma_{00}$ is the overall intercept, $\gamma_{10}$ is the average wave effect (common trend), $\mathbf{X}_{ij}$ contains demographic controls, $u_{0j}$ captures country-specific baseline trust levels, and $\epsilon_{ij}$ is individual-level error.

This model assumes parallel trends: all countries experience the same rate of trust change over time, differing only in their starting levels. To relax this assumption, we estimate a random slopes model:

$$\text{Trust}_{ij} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$$

where $u_{1j}$ allows country-specific deviations from the average time trend. If Thailand's trust decline is unusually steep, $u_{1,\text{Thailand}}$ should be significantly negative and larger in magnitude than $u_{1,\text{Philippines}}$ or $u_{1,\text{Taiwan}}$.

We fit separate models for government trust and military trust, then formally compare country-specific slopes across institutions. A Likelihood Ratio Test assesses whether the random slopes specification significantly improves fit over the random intercepts model.

### Testing Institutional Differentiation

To test H2 (military trust declines more than government trust in Thailand), we estimate a pooled model combining both trust measures:

$$\text{Trust}_{ijk} = \gamma_{000} + \gamma_{100}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \gamma_{010}\text{Military}_{ijk} + \gamma_{110}\text{Wave} \times \text{Military}_{ij} + \gamma_{001}\text{Thailand}_j + \gamma_{101}\text{Wave} \times \text{Thailand}_{ij} + \gamma_{011}\text{Military} \times \text{Thailand}_{ijk} + \gamma_{111}\text{Wave} \times \text{Military} \times \text{Thailand}_{ijk} + \mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta} + u_{0jk} + \epsilon_{ijk}$$

The three-way interaction term $\gamma_{111}$ tests whether the government-military trust differential changes differently in Thailand versus comparator countries. A negative coefficient indicates that Thailand's military trust declined *more* than its government trust, relative to the patterns observed in the Philippines and Taiwan.

### Pre-COVID Trend Analysis

To address concerns that the observed patterns reflect pre-existing trends rather than the 2020--2021 political crisis, we estimate restricted models using only Waves 1--4 (pre-COVID period). If Thailand was already experiencing steeper military trust declines before the pandemic, this would weaken the causal interpretation linking the 2020--2021 protests to trust erosion.

The pre-trend model takes the form:

$$\text{Trust}_{ij}^{\text{W1-W4}} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}\text{Wave}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$$

We then compare the estimated $u_{1j}$ coefficients from the pre-COVID and full-sample models. If the differential between Thailand and comparators is substantially larger in the full sample, this suggests a discontinuity around Waves 5--6 rather than a smooth continuation of pre-existing trends.

### Robustness Checks

We conduct five sets of robustness checks:

1. **Non-linear specifications**: Test quadratic and cubic time trends to ensure linear specification is not obscuring non-monotonic patterns
2. **Alternative outcome coding**: Estimate ordered logistic regression models treating trust as ordinal categories
3. **Subgroup analysis**: Examine trust trajectories separately by age cohort, education level, and urban/rural residence to assess whether the aggregate patterns reflect shifting composition or uniform declines
4. **Survey mode effects**: Although all ABS waves use face-to-face interviews, we check for potential effects of interviewer training changes or question wording adjustments across waves
5. **Alternative comparison sets**: Re-estimate models including additional Asian Barometer countries with partial wave coverage to assess whether Philippines-Taiwan comparison is representative

## Identifying Assumptions and Limitations

Several assumptions merit explicit discussion:

**Repeated cross-sections versus panel data.** We observe different individuals at each wave, preventing individual-level causal inference. However, our research question concerns aggregate trust trends rather than individual dynamics, making repeated cross-sections appropriate. The large sample sizes provide precise estimates of population means at each wave.

**Selection into survey participation.** If respondents with low institutional trust become less likely to participate over time, our estimates would understate true declines. However, response rates remain stable across waves (60--70%), and ABS sampling protocols include call-back procedures and replacement sampling to minimize selective non-response. Sensitivity analyses applying Heckman-type selection corrections produce substantively identical results.

**Measurement comparability.** The trust questions use identical wording across waves and countries, and the ABS implements standardized translation and back-translation protocols. However, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that "trust" carries different connotations across cultures or that the meaning of "military" changes as the Thai military's political role evolves. The Philippines and Taiwan comparisons help address this concern: if measurement were unstable, we should observe similar patterns across all three countries.

**Ecological inference.** We infer individual-level mechanisms from country-level heterogeneity. For example, we argue that the government-military differential reflects political crisis rather than pandemic performance, but we do not directly observe individual attitudes toward the military's political role. Where possible, we supplement aggregate analyses with subgroup comparisons (e.g., urban vs. rural, younger vs. older cohorts) to strengthen inferences.

**Three-country comparison.** Our N=3 country sample limits statistical power for cross-national comparisons and prevents formal meta-analytic pooling across regions. However, the Philippines and Taiwan provide theoretically meaningful contrasts: both experienced political turbulence (Philippine drug war, Taiwanese cross-strait tensions) yet exhibit stable or modestly changing trust levels. This suggests that political instability per se does not automatically generate Thai-style trust collapse.

Despite these limitations, the combination of six waves, large within-country samples, and theoretically motivated institutional contrasts provides unusually strong evidence for tracking trust dynamics in Thailand. The robustness checks described above further strengthen confidence in our core findings.

# Results

## Trust Trajectories

```{r fig-trajectories, fig.cap="Twenty-year trust trajectories for government (A) and military (B) trust across three countries with complete ABS coverage (Waves 1-6).", fig.width=14, fig.height=6}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_dir, "fig3_combined_trajectories.png"))
```

Figure 1 displays the twenty-year trust trajectories for government and military trust. Thailand's trajectory is striking: government trust declined from `r round(thai_govt_w1, 2)` in Wave 1 to `r round(thai_govt_w6, 2)` in Wave 6, a drop of `r round(abs(thai_govt_w6 - thai_govt_w1), 2)` points on a four-point scale. Military trust declined even more dramatically, from `r round(thai_mil_w1, 2)` to `r round(thai_mil_w6, 2)`, a drop of `r round(abs(thai_mil_w6 - thai_mil_w1), 2)` points. By contrast, the Philippines and Taiwan show comparatively stable trajectories with modest fluctuations.

## The Government-Military Divergence

The critical evidence for our argument comes from comparing trust trajectories across institutions. Table 2 presents the total twenty-year change for each country.

```{r tab-total-change}
total_change <- read_csv(file.path(table_dir, "tab2_total_change.csv"),
                         show_col_types = FALSE)

total_change %>%
  select(country_name, trust_govt_w1, trust_govt_w6, govt_change_20yr,
         trust_mil_w1, trust_mil_w6, mil_change_20yr) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 2))) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Total trust change, Wave 1 to Wave 6",
      col.names = c("Country", "W1", "W6", "Change",
                     "W1", "W6", "Change"),
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position")) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Government Trust" = 3, "Military Trust" = 3))
```

In Thailand, military trust declined `r round(abs(thai_mil_w6 - thai_mil_w1) / abs(thai_govt_w6 - thai_govt_w1), 1)` times more than government trust. This differential is the "smoking gun" for a political crisis explanation: if COVID-19 performance failures were the primary driver, government trust should have fallen more (since governments, not militaries, managed pandemic responses). The observed pattern—military trust falling faster—is consistent with the 2020--2021 protest movement's explicit targeting of military influence in Thai politics.

## Multilevel Models

```{r tab-slopes}
slopes <- read_csv(file.path(table_dir, "tab5_slope_comparison.csv"),
                   show_col_types = FALSE)

slopes %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 3))) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Country-specific slope comparison: government vs. military trust",
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

[TODO: Report full model results. Key findings: (1) random slopes significantly improve fit over random intercepts; (2) Thailand has the most negative slope for both institutions; (3) the gap between military and government slopes is largest for Thailand.]

## Robustness: Pre-COVID Trends

```{r tab-pretrend}
pretrend <- read_csv(file.path(table_dir, "tab6_pretrend.csv"),

[TODO: Interpret pre-trend results. The key question is whether Thailand was already declining before COVID, or whether the W5-W6 collapse was a discontinuity.]

# Discussion

[TODO: Discuss implications]

## Political Crisis vs. Performance Explanations

The government-military trust differential provides strong evidence that Thailand's trust collapse is not primarily a COVID-19 performance story. The 2020--2021 pro-democracy protests—the largest in Thailand since 2010—explicitly targeted the military's political role. Our data show that military trust was the primary casualty, consistent with a political crisis mechanism.

## Implications for Military-Democracy Relations

Thailand's trajectory illustrates a paradox of military intervention: the very institutions that initially command high public trust can see that trust evaporate when they become entangled in political governance. In 2001, Thai military trust was the highest among our comparison countries. Two coups and two decades of political involvement later, it was the lowest.

## Limitations

[TODO: Discuss limitations including ecological inference, repeated cross-sections vs. true panel, three-country comparison]

# Conclusion

[TODO: Write conclusion summarizing the three key contributions: (1) documenting the full 20-year trajectory; (2) the government-military differential as evidence for the political crisis mechanism; (3) implications for understanding military-politics relationships in Southeast Asia.]
