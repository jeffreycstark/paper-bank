## Abstract (150-200 words)

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered rally-around-the-flag effects worldwide, with citizens initially expressing heightened trust in their governments. But what happened when the rally ended? This article uses three waves of Asian Barometer Survey data (2016-2022, N ≈ 18,000) to trace government trust trajectories in five Southeast and East Asian polities: Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan. The findings reveal sharply divergent paths. In Thailand and Indonesia, initial trust surges during the early pandemic completely reversed by 2022, with Thailand experiencing the steepest collapse—a full point drop on a four-point scale—amid compounding political and public health crises. Vietnam maintained high but flat trust throughout. Taiwan, the sole democracy to register trust *gains*, stands as the exception that proves the rule: effective pandemic governance converted crisis into legitimacy. These patterns suggest that rally effects are not self-sustaining; without credible performance, they accelerate disillusionment rather than consolidate support. For Southeast Asia's fragile democracies, the post-pandemic trust deficit poses risks for democratic consolidation that extend well beyond the health crisis itself.

## Introduction

When COVID-19 swept across Southeast Asia in early 2020, governments faced a dual test: managing an unprecedented public health crisis while maintaining political legitimacy under extraordinary constraints. Initial evidence suggested many were succeeding. From Jakarta to Bangkok, surveys captured what scholars call "rally-around-the-flag" effects—spikes in public trust as citizens deferred to state authority in the face of shared threat. For a region marked by fragile institutions and contested legitimacy, this seemed a rare opportunity: a crisis that might, paradoxically, strengthen the social contract between states and citizens.

Two years later, that optimism has faded. This article traces what happened after the rally ended. Using three waves of Asian Barometer Survey data spanning 2016 to 2022—capturing pre-pandemic baselines, early pandemic responses, and post-pandemic assessments—I show that the trust landscape across Southeast Asia has been fundamentally reshaped, but not in the direction that early rally effects predicted.

The findings reveal three distinct trajectories. In Thailand and Indonesia, the largest democracies in the region, early trust gains completely reversed. Thailand's collapse was the most dramatic: government trust fell by more than a full point on a four-point scale between 2019 and 2022, driven by compounding failures in pandemic management and intensifying political repression. Indonesia's trajectory was subtler but equally telling—a sharp rally-around-the-flag surge in 2019-2020 gave way to disillusionment as the Delta wave exposed the limits of the state's capacity. The Philippines followed a similar if more muted pattern. 

Vietnam presents a different picture: high baseline trust that remained essentially flat throughout the pandemic. This stability likely reflects both effective early containment and the limited space for expressed dissent in a single-party system. Trust neither rallied nor collapsed because it had less room to move.

Taiwan alone converted crisis into legitimacy. The sole polity in the sample to register trust *gains* across the pandemic period, Taiwan's success story is well known: early border closures, effective test-and-trace systems, transparent communication, and low death tolls until the Omicron wave of 2022. What the survey data reveal is that citizens noticed—and rewarded their government accordingly.

These divergent trajectories matter beyond the pandemic itself. Government trust is not merely a public opinion curiosity; it shapes citizens' willingness to comply with policy, pay taxes, and accept the legitimacy of political institutions. For Thailand and Indonesia, the post-pandemic trust deficit arrives at a precarious moment. Thailand's military-backed government faces persistent youth-led protests demanding democratic reform. Indonesia's democratic consolidation, long seen as a regional success story, confronts growing concerns about executive overreach and institutional decay. In both cases, the pandemic appears to have accelerated rather than arrested erosion of state legitimacy.

The remainder of this article proceeds as follows. I first review the rally-around-the-flag literature and its application to pandemic politics, identifying the conditions under which initial trust surges might consolidate or reverse. I then describe the Asian Barometer data and the five-country sample, which spans diverse regime types and pandemic experiences. The empirical sections trace trust trajectories in each country before turning to statistical models that examine whether pandemic severity, economic shocks, and governance quality explain cross-national variation. I conclude by discussing implications for democratic consolidation in post-pandemic Southeast Asia.

## Key Findings to Include

| Country | Trust Change (W5→W6) | Context |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| Thailand | −1.05 | Compounding political + health crisis |
| Indonesia | −0.77 | Rally → crash pattern |
| Philippines | −0.25 | Moderate decline |
| Vietnam | −0.02 | Stable (autocratic baseline) |
| Taiwan | +0.27 | Performance → legitimacy |

## Theoretical Framework (brief)

1. **Rally-around-the-flag** literature predicts short-term trust boosts during crises
2. **Performance legitimacy** literature suggests sustained trust requires delivery
3. The pandemic was a *stress test*: rally effects that weren't backed by performance collapsed
4. **Regime type** conditions the pattern: democracies show more volatility; autocracies show stability (Vietnam) or repression-driven decline (Thailand post-2020)

## Policy Relevance (for JCSAA framing)

- Trust deficits constrain future crisis response capacity
- Thailand's collapse coincides with ongoing democratic backsliding
- Indonesia's trajectory raises questions about democratic consolidation
- Taiwan's success offers lessons but may not be replicable
- Regional implications for ASEAN health cooperation, economic recovery
