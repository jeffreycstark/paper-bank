# Meaning of Democracy - Validated YAML (v3)
# Forced-choice questions about essential characteristics of democracy
# Each set presents 4 options mixing substantive/economic and procedural/political choices
# NOTE: W1/W2/W5 have different question formats - see dem_essential_harmonized for cross-wave version
# Validated 2025-01-14

# ===========================================================================
# HARMONIZED CROSS-WAVE VARIABLE (W2-W6)
# The single "most essential" question appears in all waves but with different
# value codes and slightly different options. This harmonization captures the
# core procedural vs substantive distinction.
# ===========================================================================
# 
# Source mapping:
#   W2: q92 (1=elections, 2=criticize, 3=income gap, 4=basic needs)
#   W3: q85 (1=gap, 2=elections, 3=no waste, 4=express views)
#   W4: q88 (1=gap, 2=elections, 3=no waste, 4=express views)  
#   W5: q98 (1=express views, 2=basic needs, 3=elections, 4=clean politics)
#   W6: q85 (1=gap, 2=elections, 3=no waste, 4=express views) - same as W3/W4
#
# Harmonization strategy:
#   - Electoral (procedural): W2=1, W3=2, W4=2, W5=3, W6=2
#   - Expressive (liberal): W2=2, W3=4, W4=4, W5=1, W6=4
#   - Redistributive (substantive): W2=3, W3=1, W4=1, W5=NA, W6=1
#   - Basic needs (substantive): W2=4, W3=NA, W4=NA, W5=2, W6=NA
#   - Good governance: W2=NA, W3=3, W4=3, W5=4, W6=3
