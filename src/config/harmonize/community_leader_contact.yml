    notes: 
      - "W1 also has q047 for community leader contact - verify if q035 or q047 (or both) should be used"
      - "Verify actual scale type and expected range - may be frequency (1-4), contact (yes/no), or other"
      - "W4 has q71/q71a notation - verify if this is q71, q71a, or combined"
