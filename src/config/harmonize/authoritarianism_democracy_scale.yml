notes: |
  This is a 10-point scale measuring self-placement on authoritarianism-democracy spectrum:
  1 = Complete dictatorship (most authoritarian)
  10 = Complete democracy (most democratic)
  
  IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS:
  - Only available in W1 and W2
  - W3-W6 do not contain this question
  - Missing codes (97, 98, 99) should be treated as NA
  
  Variable candidates in W1: q099, q100, q101, q102 (all appear to be same scale)
  Variable candidates in W2: q95, q96, q97 (all appear to be same scale)
  Currently using q099 (W1) and q95 (W2) as primary measures
  
  Unlike corruption and democracy satisfaction (4-point scales), this remains
  as 1-10 scale per user specification for identity preservation.
